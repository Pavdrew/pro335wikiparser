      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">'''MLB Industry Growth Fund''' is a pool of money collected by [[Major League Baseball]].  The purpose of the Industry Growth Fund (IGF) is, essentially, to promote Major League Baseball.  Specifically, there are three goals; to enhance fan interest in the game, to increase [[baseball]]'s popularity, and to ensure industry growth into the 21st century.  It was created as part of the Major League Baseball (MLB) [[Collective bargaining|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA) in 1997.

The IGF is managed by a seven-member [[board of directors]].  The board of directors meets in person at least three times per year.

Funding for the IGF comes, primarily, from the MLB Competitive Balance Tax.  Additional funds may also come from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA) or the individual baseball clubs.&lt;ref&gt;MLB CBA Article XXV&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Major League Baseball Australian Academy Program''' (MLBAAP) is a seven-week [[professional baseball|baseball]] development program held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia for prospective [[Baseball in Australia|Australian baseball]] [[baseball positions|players]] and officials.

The Academy began in 2001 with the backing of the [[Australian Baseball Federation]], [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[Australian Sports Commission]], with the aim of improving the quantity and quality of young Australian baseball players. The Academy has included notable MLB coaches such as [[Rod Carew]], [[Pat Kelly (outfielder)|Pat Kelly]], [[Graeme Lloyd]], [[David Nilsson]], [[Mark Hutton]] and [[Luke Prokopec]]. MLBAAP has been the catalyst for over 140 professional player signings, boasts 2 Major league players among its alumni ([[Rich Thompson (pitcher, born 1984)|Rich Thompson]] and [[Brad Harman]]) and has seen many more progress through the ranks of the [[Australia national baseball team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseball.com.au/?Page=52114&amp;MenuID=Programs%2F4%2F0%2CMLBAAP%2F22397%2F36377%2CNews%2F21132%2F0%2F0 2009 Scholarships Announced.] ''Australian Baseball Federation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meers|first=Daniel|title=US pitches in and league has lift-off |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/07/02/94281_gold-coast-sport.html|publisher=GoldCoast.com|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The location of the Academy is the [[Palm Meadows]] [[Radisson Hotel]] resort, which includes a world-class baseball facility. Players are  split into four teams ([[Roo]]s, [[Wombat]]s, [[Koala]]s and [[Dingo]]s) and the program is set up very much like professional [[Rookie League|rookie leagues]] in North America. Academic staff from several Gold Coast state schools and the Gold Coast Institute of [[TAFE]] assist with tutoring and supporting the athletes, to ensure their educational requirements are achieved. Teaching staff are chosen on their experience and empathy regarding the difficult combination of balancing elite sport with academic excellence. Education sessions are conducted Monday to Friday, with an expectation that year 11 and 12 athletes set aside at least 2 hours additional time per Saturday and Sunday for private study.

The seven-week program consists of at least one match a day against each other and other touring teams, with a break on Sunday, giving players and officials plenty of match practice. Between 60 and 80 players are given a scholarship from all states and territories of mainland Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morriss|first=Grey|title=NT-bred baseballer off to the 'Big Show|url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2010/04/21/141611_ntsport.html|publisher=NTNews.com.au|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other invitees from countries including [[Taiwan]], Japan, New Zealand, [[South Africa]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[New Caledonia]] and [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brock|first=Corey|title=Reed on rehab trial|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060721&amp;content_id=1568262&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|title=Tribe optimistic about Czech signing|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090221&amp;content_id=3860342&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[manager (baseball)|head coach]] is national team manager [[Jon Deeble]], who is supported by national team [[coach (baseball)|coaching]] staff [[Phil Dale]], Tony Harris, Pat Kelly, Graeme Lloyd and Dave Nilsson. As of {{baseball year|2010}}, there are 84 Australians playing professionally in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pflintoff.com/USSTATS.htm Flintoff and Dunn]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7248">In baseball, a '''[[Captain (sports)|captain]]''' is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by [[Manager (baseball)|managers]] and [[Coach (baseball)|coaches]], such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dickson | first=Paul | title=The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary | publisher=Mariner Books | year=1999 | page=101 | isbn=0-15-600580-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/newdicksonbaseba00dick }}&lt;/ref&gt; In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=ASEP | title=Coaching Baseball: Technical and Tactical Skills | publisher=Human Kinetics | year=2005 | page=240 | isbn=0-7360-4703-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Baseball]]'s official rules only briefly mention the position of team captain.  Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment) which discusses the submission of a team's lineup to the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Official Baseball Rules | date=1949â€“2010 | publisher=Major League Baseball | page=32 | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Major League Baseball, only a handful of teams have designated a player as captain in recent years, and there are no current team captains. [[Jerry Remy]], who was named as captain of the [[California Angels]] in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, "there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team.  I think there are guys who lead by example.  You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Remy | first=Jerry |author2=Corey Sandler | title=Watching Baseball: Discovering the Game Within the Game | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2006 | page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not wear an [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-style [[Captain (ice hockey)|"C"]] on their jersey. Retired first baseman [[Mike Sweeney]], former captain of the [[Kansas City Royals]] from 2003 to 2007, wore the "C" patch, as did two other recently retired captains: [[John Franco]] of the [[New York Mets]], and [[Jason Varitek]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball.  For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as "coachers" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as "captain's lines." If the umpire made a decision that could "be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal", the "captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal."  The rules state that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules do not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chadwick | first=Henry | title=Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide: 1898 | publisher=American Sports Publishing Company | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIdLAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q=%22base%20ball%22%20captain%20manager&amp;f=false  | pages=169â€“171, 175, 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains.  They held the title of "manager-captain."&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1902 the newspapers refer to "Captain-Manager [[John McGraw]] and [[Joe Kelley]]"; see {{cite news | title=M'Graw at Polo Grounds: Six of the New York Baseball Team Are Released | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 18, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/07/18/117979853.pdf }} and {{cite news | title=Yesterday's Baseball Games: New York and Cincinnati Teams Each Win a Game at the Polo Groundsâ€”Brooklyn Won | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 14, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/08/14/101962901.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902 [[Jack Doyle (baseball)|Jack Doyle]] was signed as captain and first baseman of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] while non-player [[Horace Fogel]] was manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Doyle Signed by New York: Famous Baseball Player to Captain the Team and Play First Baseâ€”Pleased with the Club's Outlook | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 27, 1902 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/02/27/101939155.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the role of a captain has been significant in the histories of teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], the [[Boston Red Sox]], and the [[San Francisco Giants]], other teams, such as the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], have, as of 2016, never had a captain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5674">The '''Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association''' (MLBPAA) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization created in 1982 by former Washington Senators player [[Chuck Hinton]] to promote the game of baseball, raise money for charities, inspire and educate youth through positive sport images, and protect the dignity of the game through former players.  It has also become a central point for former MLB players to keep in contact with each other and connect with current players.

{{TOC right}}

==About the Organization==
The MLBPAA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-alumni.com MLBPAA]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is headquartered in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and currently has more than 7,500 members: current and former major league players, umpires, managers, coaches, and front-office personnel, and fans. Through its charitable efforts, the MLBPAA has raised $42 million for both local and national charities including, but not limited to Children's Hospitals, [[American Diabetes Association]], [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Clubs]], [[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]], [[Special Olympics]], [[Leukemia Society of America]], the [[Salvation Army]], [[Meals on Wheels]] and [[Little League Baseball]].

==Legends for Youth Clinics==
The Legends for Youth Clinic Series teaches young ballplayers (ages 6 to 16) the fundamentals of the game in a multi-station format, and stresses the importance of education to help kids recognize they have the ability to make positive decisions. Since the program's inception, the Legends for Youth clinics have reached more than 150,000 children across the United States, Europe, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, and the US Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlbpaa.mlb.com/mlbpaa/about/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swing with the Legends Golf Series==
Created in 1984, the golf events have featured some of the greatest names in baseball history. Reaching more than 30 cities across the United States, the series raises funds for both local and national charities as well as the Alumni Association. These events are held at some of the premier golf courses around the nation{{Where|date=July 2011}} and provide each participant with an exciting{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} weekend with their favorite baseball stars of yesterday.

==Legends for Youth Dinner==
The Legends for Youth Dinner is the primary fundraiser for the MLBPAA's Legend for Youth Clinic Series. Established in 1999, the dinner recognizes former players' on- and off-field accomplishments along with their contributions to communities across the nation. Other awards given out at the dinner for current Major League players include the National and American League Pitcher and Player of the Year Awards, the Dick Schaap Memorial Player of the Year Award, and the Heart and Hustle Award.

===Heart &amp; Hustle Award===
{{Main|Heart &amp; Hustle Award}}
The Heart &amp; Hustle Award was created by the MLBPAA in 2005 and is presented annually to the current player who demonstrates a "passion for the game of baseball and best embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game."  The winner is voted on by both alumni and active players and is awarded at the annual Legends for Youth Dinner in New York City.

==Subsidiaries==
To help former players, the MLBPAA wholly owns two for-profit organizations, MLAM (Major League Alumni Marketing) and MLAS (Major League Alumni Services).

===Major League Alumni Marketing===
MLAM was created to gain compensation for former players through endorsements and appearances, while protecting the names and likenesses of the individuals. Players are able to sign a Player Pool Agreement, which is a pool of group licensing and other marketing monies that are annually divided equally among the members. MLAM is separated into two divisions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Legends Memorabilia Collection''' (LMC) is one of seven licensed dealers of authentic Major League Baseball memorabilia. LMC was started to fulfill a niche and offer memorabilia signed by any living player who has ever played the game. Throughout the year, LMC hosts numerous private signings with Hall of Famers and many miscellaneous players who have experienced the big leagues. In 2011, LMC sponsored over 100 live auctions at Major League Ball Parks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Legends Entertainment Group''' (LEG) actively promotes players through endorsement deals and personal appearances. Since 1999, over $5 million has been paid to the alumni player (80% of these being non-Hall of Fame players).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Major League Alumni Services===
MLAS strives to broaden membership programs including medical and pension benefits, while providing services outside the non-profit framework for the direct benefit of MLBPAA members such as free heart and lung care for former players, courtesy of Deborah Hospital.

The '''Baseball Assistance Team''' is a 501(c)(3) [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] organization affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]]. The organization's mission is to "confidentially support members of the ''[[Baseball]] Family'' in need of assistance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.mlb.com/baseball-assistance-team/about-bat&lt;/ref&gt; The baseball family includes former players, both from the Major and [[Minor league baseball|Minor Leagues]], former [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] and [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] players, [[umpire]]s, scouts, and MLB and MiLB team personnel.

==History==
The Baseball Assistance Team was founded in 1986 during the term of Commissioner [[Peter Ueberroth]] as a way for Major League Baseball and its players to take care of former players who have fallen upon hard times. Eligibility for help from B.A.T. has since been expanded to include those with two years of service as Major League and Minor League front office personnel, [[Umpire (baseball)|umpires]], [[Scout (sport)|scouts]], [[Minor league baseball|Minor League]] players, athletic trainers, former [[Negro League]] baseball players, women from the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]], former [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] employees, and their widows, widowers, and children under the age of 23. B.A.T. has expanded its efforts into Latin America where they have provided help to players from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This organization was founded with the goal of helping members of the ''Baseball Family'' during times of hardship, not as a long-term program but as a bridge to help people become self-sufficient. In 1991, a contribution from Major League Baseball, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]], and the [[Freedoms Foundation|Freedom Foundation]] established an endowment for B.A.T.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While B.A.T. was not, and is not, meant to be a substitute for a pension or retirement savings, it is able to assist in times of need.

In 2018, B.A.T. created a scholarship program for former Major and Minor League players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/baseball-assistance-team/scholarship-application|title=Baseball Assistance Team Scholarship Application|website=MLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed to provide financial assistance in the pursuit of educational and vocational opportunities related to career growth goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/bat-helping-todd-coffey-get-college-degree/c-295960730|title=B.A.T. helping Todd Coffey get college degree|website=MLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising==
[[Major League Baseball]] provides for the overhead expenses of the Baseball Assistance Team, including salary and travel expenses, which allows all funds raised to be donated to grant recipients. To date, B.A.T. has provided over 3,900 grants totaling over $38 million in assistance.[[File:BATsupport.jpg|thumb|right|Player support for B.A.T.]]

===Spring Training Visits===
The annual B.A.T. Spring Training Fundraising Tour is another major endeavor for B.A.T.  Since 2003, members of B.A.T. have visited each team in Major League Baseball and solicited donations, all of which are given back to former players and members of the ''Baseball Family'' in need. Through the payroll deduction program, players and coaches can pledge a portion of their salary to B.A.T. which goes directly to the grants. Most importantly, the visits also educate the players to be the eyes and the ears of B.A.T. by notifying the organization about anyone who may be in need of assistance. The teams that donate the most money to B.A.T. are honored each year with the [[Bobby Murcer]] Award. The 2018 Bobby Murcer Award recipients are the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and the [[Washington Nationals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/bat-names-orioles-and-nationals-recipients-of-bobby-murcer-award/c-269276032|title=B.A.T. names Orioles and Nationals recipients of Bobby Murcer Award|website=MLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20852">The '''Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule''' consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the [[American League]] (AL) and [[National League]] (NL), played over approximately six monthsâ€”a total of&lt;!--NOTE: there are TWO teams per game; 4860/2 = 2430 --&gt; 2,430 games, plus the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]]. The [[regular season]] runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November.  The season begins with the official [[Opening Day]], and, as of 2018, runs 26Â½ weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the [[United States]] before the official Opening Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Details of MLB, MLBPA labor agreement|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/details-of-mlb-mlbpa-labor-agreement/c-210125462|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cba_english"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017â€“2021 Basic Agreement|url=http://www.mlbplayers.com/pdf9/5450407.pdf#page=17|format=PDF|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLBPlayers.com|date=July 28, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] and advances to each of the [[Division Series]], [[League Championship Series|Championship Series]], and [[World Series]] with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games each in the League Championship Series/World Series).

The regular season is constructed from [[Series (baseball)|series]].  Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game, or more rarely, a one-game playoff to determine a postseason berth); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark.  Most often the series are of three or four games, but two-game series are also scheduled.  Teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week. Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday.  Beginning in 2018, teams start and end their season on a weekend for a total of 26Â½ weeks. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play 27 weekend series and 25 mid-week series for a total of 52 series (24 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 8 inter-league series).  A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.

Note that [[Rainout (sports)#Baseball|rainouts]] and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]s.  However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there is no impact on the divisional or wild card races.  For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Detroit Tigers]] was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it did not affect the divisional race.  In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the [[Chicago White Sox]] needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the [[Minnesota Twins]].

==Historical season schedules==
This account gives the length of the major league "championship season" schedule by league and year. It does not cover the curtailment of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the [[strike action|strike]] that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited [[spring training]].

The listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule. For example, the National League (NL) scheduled 84 games during 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882 â€“ that is, four seasons from 1879, ending before 1883, the next listing. 1876 is listed here for convenience although the NL did not schedule games (see 1871 to 1876, [[#National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|below]]).

===American Association===
1882 â€“ 1891

:1882: 80 games â€“ 16 games Ã— 5 opponents
:1883: 98 games â€“ 14 games Ã— 7 opponents
:1884: 112 games â€“ 16 games Ã— 7 opponents
:1886: 140 games â€“ 20 games Ã— 7 opponents
Thus the AA expanded its schedule to 140 games two years before the National League did so. After 1891 four AA clubs joined the NL and four were bought out, nominally creating one big league, the "National League and American Association" of 12 clubs.

===Union Association===
1884

:1884: 112 games â€“ 16 games Ã— 7 opponents

===Players' League===
1890

:1890: 140 games â€“ 20 games Ã— 7 opponents

===Federal League===

1914: 1915
:1914 â€“ 154 games â€“ 22 games x 7 opponents

===National Association of Professional Base Ball Players===
The [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (1871â€“1875) did not schedule games, nor did it control the number of teams, a major reason for its demise after the 1875 season. Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy [[investment]], there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs [[bankruptcy|going out of business]].

The National League organized for 1876 on a different basis, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year â€” it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date.  Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions, 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.

For all six early seasons, prior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs. Some may have practically dictated their arrangements with some others, but there was no central control or coordination.

This listing gives the greatest number of games played by any club for each season. Naturally, the leader by games played was always a strong club fielding one of the better gate attractions.

:1871: 33 games (Mutual, New York)
:1872: 58 games (Lord Baltimore)
:1873: 60 games (Boston)
:1874: 71 games (Boston)
:1875: 86 games (Hartford)
:1876: 70 games (Boston) â€“ the first National League season (see text)
The leading numbers of games played to a decision were 33, 54, 59, 71, 82, and 70 decisions; by the listed teams except the Mutuals in 1872.

==Recent season schedules==
===1998 to 2012===
Since 1998, there have been 30 major league teams with a single advance schedule for every season that comprises 2430 games.  Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the "[[home (sports)|home]]" team, 81 as the "visitor". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a [[Baseball park|ballpark]] not home to either team.)  Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.

Before 2013, the schedule included 252 "interleague games" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games. These interleague games were played from mid-to-late May to late June or early July.

'''Division games''' (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.

*25 pairings will play 19 games each (475 games)
*21 pairings will play 18 games each (378 games)
*13 pairings will play 16 games each (208 games) â€“ most NL Central pairings
*2 pairings will play 15 games each (30 games) â€“ two NL Central pairings
*Total: 1091 games.

'''Other intraleague games''' (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.

*23 pairings will play 10 games each (230 games)
*15 pairings will play 9 games each (135 games)
*8 pairings will play 8 games each (64 games)
*34 pairings will play 7 games each (238 games)
*70 pairings will play 6 games each (420 games)
*Total: 1087 games.

====Interleague play====
{{main|Interleague play}}

The schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.

Among the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series "home and home", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.

* Baltimore vs. Washington
* Chicago Cubs (North Side) vs. Chicago White Sox (South Side)
* Cincinnati vs. Cleveland
* Miami vs. Tampa Bay (Tampa/St. Petersburg)
* Houston vs. Texas (Arlington)
* Kansas City vs. St. Louis
* Los Angeles Angels vs. Los Angeles Dodgers
* Milwaukee vs. Minnesota (Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* New York Mets (Queens) vs. New York Yankees (Bronx)
* Oakland vs. San Francisco
* San Diego vs. Seattle

These special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998-2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.

====9/11 rescheduling====
The 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11â€“16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and [[World Series]] being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates. This resulted in the World Series continuing into early November for the first time.

===2013â€“2017===
Schedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games.&lt;ref name="2013MLBSchedule" /&gt; Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.) With this change, interleague games were now scattered throughout the season.

The matched divisions rotate annually:
*AL East vs. NL West (2013), vs. NL Central (2014)
*AL Central vs. NL East (2013), vs. NL West (2014)
*AL West vs. NL Central (2013), vs. NL East (2014)

Each team played its four other interleague games against a designated "natural rival", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league. In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.

Ten of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the Houstonâ€“Texas "Lone Star" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 {{â€¡}}, including one each for Houston and Texas.

* Baltimore vs. Washington
* Boston vs. Philadelphia {{â€¡}}
* New York Mets (Queens) vs. New York Yankees (Bronx)
* Miami vs. Tampa Bay (Tampa/St. Petersburg)
* Toronto vs. Atlanta {{â€¡}}
* Chicago Cubs (North Side) vs. Chicago White Sox (South Side)
* Cincinnati vs. Cleveland
* Detroit vs. Pittsburgh {{â€¡}}
* Kansas City vs. St. Louis
* Milwaukee vs. Minnesota (Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* Houston vs. Colorado {{â€¡}}
* Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. Los Angeles Dodgers
* Oakland vs. San Francisco
* San Diego vs. Seattle
* Texas vs. Arizona {{â€¡}}

For 2014, four (4) of the five (5) new rivalries have been revised (â€¡), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.
* Baltimore and Washington
* Boston vs. Atlanta (until 1952, both teams were based in [[Fenwayâ€“Kenmore]]) {{â€¡}}
* New York Mets (Queens) vs. New York Yankees (Bronx)
* Miami vs. Tampa Bay (Tampa/St. Petersburg)
* Toronto vs. Philadelphia {{â€¡}}
* Chicago Cubs (North Side) vs. Chicago White Sox (South Side)
* Cincinnati vs. Cleveland
* Detroit vs. Pittsburgh
* Kansas City vs. St. Louis
* Milwaukee vs. Minnesota (Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* Houston vs. Arizona {{â€¡}}
* Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. Los Angeles Dodgers
* Oakland vs. San Francisco
* San Diego vs. Seattle
* Texas vs. Colorado {{â€¡}}

Every team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), as well as 6 games each against 4 opponents and 7 games against each of the other 6 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).

When corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3 game series (14 total) against the other two teams in the opposing division.  This was done in 2015 and 2018, and will next occur in 2021.

=== 2018â€“present ===
Under the collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, several changes were made to the scheduling pattern for the 2018 season. The overall length of the season was extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams were scheduled to play on Opening Day, which for 2018 was March 29. ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the [[Home Run Derby]]. A single, nationally televised night game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Mark|title=2018 Major League Baseball schedule released|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/253826800/2018-major-league-baseball-schedule-released/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|language=en-US|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Eric|title=MLB minimum salary, 10-day DL, the 187-day season, and other CBA minutiae|url=https://www.truebluela.com/2016/12/1/13803320/mlb-cba-minutiae-minimum-salary-10-day-disabled-list|website=[[SB Nation]]|date=December 1, 2016|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time of first pitch==
Start of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. Most games start at 7pm in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] home games. Getaway days, days on which teams play their last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are often day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]''.

About half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4pm ET).  In some markets, Saturday night start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for getaway days while many weekend games are played during the day.

The initial pitch typically occurs 5 or 10 minutes after the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.

Headquartered in [[Ontario, California]], the MLBSB's efforts supplement the independent, proprietary amateur and professional scouting operations of the 30 [[Major League Baseball]] clubs. In 2012, the MLBSB employed 34 full-time and 13 part-time scouts in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="mic"&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/scouting_overview.jsp MLB.com: Major League Scouting Bureau Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it announced plans to expand its activities beyond Puerto Rico to other countries in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/baseball/mlb/04/02/latin.america.operations/index.html [[Sports Illustrated]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to MLB.com, the MLBSB's scouts "provide information on amateur prospects as a part of its mission to support the efforts of MLB clubs in the [[Major League Baseball Draft|First-Year Player Draft]]. The MLBSB also provides professional scouting services, including the collection of video footage of players throughout the professional ranks, both domestically and internationally."&lt;ref name="meg"&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/careers/index.jsp?loc=mlbsb MLB.com: MLBSB Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;  It maintains an eligibility file on amateur players â€” many of them teenagers â€” and holds 35 tryout camps each June in its countries of operation.&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;

The current MLBSB was founded in 1974 by outgoing [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Jim Wilson (pitcher)|Jim Wilson]], and became part of the commissioner's office in 1985.&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt; However, its roots date to the founding by Major League owners of the Central Scouting Bureau in 1968, a period of time when many big league clubs were down-sizing their scouting departments.&lt;ref&gt;Roewe.

In August 1968, Fanning resigned after seven months with the CSB to become general manager of the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Montreal Expos]].

From 1998â€“2014, the MLBSB was supervised by director, and then senior director, Frank Marcos. He announced his departure from the bureau in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballamerica.com/draft/scouting-bureau-director-marcos-leave/ Baseball America]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was succeeded by former Major League executive [[Bill Bavasi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballamerica.com/draft/industry-vet-bill-bavasi-slated-lead-mlsb/ Baseball America 2014.11.21]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Major League Baseball, {{quote|The MLB Fan Cave grew out of our desire to address three specific areas in which we saw opportunity for growth:  engaging with fans via social media, both at the league level and through players; reaching younger fans and converting casual baseball fans into more avid followers; and raising the profile of our players by showcasing their off-field personalities|Tim Brosnan, MLB Executive Vice President of Business|Lostremote.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the MLB Fan Cave became the league's social strategy|url=http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/21/how-the-mlb-fan-cave-became-the-leagues-social-strategy-interview/|publisher=Lostremote.com|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529221616/http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/21/how-the-mlb-fan-cave-became-the-leagues-social-strategy-interview/|archivedate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The "cave dwellers" (fans selected to live in the Fan Cave) were responsible for recording their experiences through social media, blogs, and videos (all online), as well as hosting concerts, fan events, and celebrity guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MLB Fan Cave|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/fancave/about.jsp#fbid=HvhM7_fipzR|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the space formerly occupied by [[Tower Records]]â€™ famed Greenwich Village location.

== 2011 Season ==
The MLB Fan Cave first opened at the beginning of the [[2011 Major League Baseball season|2011 season]] with two cave dwellers, Mike O'Hara, a 37-year-old Yankee fan and Ryan Wagner, a 25-year-old Orioles fan, selected to live in the Fan Cave from a pool of 10,000 applicants. The application process included a video submission, writing samples, and interviews with MLB Network and MLB executives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fan Cave dwellers ready to dig in for long haul|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110330&amp;content_id=17195882&amp;vkey=news_mlb|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, nine more Cave Dwellers joined the MLB Fan Cave.

The season ended with three finalists watching the Boston Red Sox win the World Series with Los Angeles Angels fan Danny Farris being named the winner of the season.

On February 9, 2015, it was reported that the Fan Cave would cease existence, and the building would be used for other promotional events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major League Baseball shuts down the Fan Cave|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/09/major-league-baseball-shuts-down-the-fan-cave/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities''' ('''RBI''') is a youth baseball program operated by [[Major League Baseball]].  This youth initiative is designed to provide young people from underserved and diverse communities the opportunity to play baseball and softball.  The program was created by [[John Young (baseball)|John Young]] in 1989 in [[Los Angeles]], and now serves more than 200 communities.

==Background==
Working as a [[scout (sports)|scout]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) following his playing career, [[John Young (baseball)|John Young]] noticed a lack of [[African American]] prospects. While working for the [[Baltimore Orioles]], he surveyed prospects selected in the [[1986 MLB Draft]], many of whom attended [[College baseball|four-year colleges]], and then noticed that among California colleges, 4% of players were African American and less than 3% were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]. He presented his findings to Orioles' [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Roland Hemond]] and [[MLB Commissioner]] [[Peter Ueberroth]]. Ueberroth contacted [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], the [[mayor of Los Angeles]], who agreed to fund a youth baseball program in Los Angeles, providing $50,000.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=mlb20/&gt; Young also received funding from the [[Amateur Athletic Union]].&lt;ref name=sunsentinel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-05-31/sports/9202120114_1_big-league-baseball-scout-bobby-tolan |title=Scout Sees Inner Cities` Hope Wasted - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=May 31, 1992 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young, with the Professional Baseball Scouts of Southern California, organized 12 teams of 180 13- and 14-year-olds in 1989, the first year of the RBI program.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|date=May 22, 1990|first=GARY |last=KLEIN |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-22/sports/sp-208_1_baseball-program |title=Program Brings Baseball Back to Inner City - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]], African American baseball players from Southern California, devoted time and money to help the program.&lt;ref name=mlb20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080224&amp;content_id=2387908&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=MLB&amp;#39;s RBI program enters 20th year &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLB took over operation of the RBI program in 1991.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; By 1992, the RBI program expanded to [[Harlem]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].&lt;ref name=sunsentinel/&gt; [[Leonard S.

'''Major League Baseball Youth Academies''' are a series of academies in American cities and one in [[Puerto Rico]] that provides free year-round instruction in [[baseball]] and [[softball]] to the areas' youth. The academies are run as not-for-profit organizations by [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).

==History==
The first Youth Academy opened in 2002 in [[Puerto Rico]] as the [[Puerto Rico Baseball Academy and High School]]. In 2006, the first Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy in the [[United States of America|United States]] was opened in [[Compton, California]], providing free baseball and softball instruction to [[Southern California]] youth, ages 8â€“17. Since then academies have opened in [[Houston, Texas]] (2010), [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] (2012), [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] (2014).

==Locations==
===Cincinnati, Ohio===
Located nine miles away from the [[Great American Ball Park]] is the [[Procter &amp; Gamble|P&amp;G]] [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] [[Major League Baseball]] Urban Youth Academy.

The '''Giantsâ€“Yankees rivalry''' is a [[Major League Baseball]] rivalry between the [[San Francisco Giants]] of the [[National League]] and the [[New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]]. It was particularly intense when both teams not only inhabited New York City but also, for a time, the same ball park.&lt;ref name = "YGB"&gt;{{cite book|title=1921: The Yankees, the Giants, and the Battle for Baseball Supremacy in New York|first=Lyle|last=Spatz|first2=Steve|last2=Steinberg|year=2010|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Ne.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that era the opportunities for them to meet could only have been in a [[World Series]]. Both teams kicked off the first [[Subway Series]] between the two leagues in 1921.

==Cross-town Rivals==

===Highlanders Come to Town===
The [[American League]] was at its infancy at the start of the 20th century. The current Yankees franchise had its origins in [[Baltimore]] as the Baltimore Orioles. At the time, rivalry between the [[National League]] and the American League was fierce. In 1902, long time National League executive [[John T. Brush]] gained a partial ownership interest in the Orioles, and released four key team members â€“ [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] manager [[John McGraw]], Hall of Fame pitcher [[Joe McGinnity]], Hall of Fame catcher [[Roger Bresnahan]] and starting first baseman [[Dan McGann]]&amp;mdash;from their Orioles' contract to join the National League New York Giants.&lt;ref name=brush&gt;{{cite web|title=John Brush|author=Saccoman, J.|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=995&amp;pid=16897|publisher=SABR|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sports Encyclopedia Baseball: 2000|author=Neft,  D., Cohen, R &amp; Neft, M.|page=18|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-20437-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sportsencycloped2000neft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honig&gt;{{cite book|title=Baseball America|author=Honig, D.|page=20|year=2001|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-2275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brush also allowed other Orioles' players to join other National League teams.&lt;ref name=honig/&gt;  Later that year, Brush became owner of the Giants.&lt;ref name=brush/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=honig/&gt;

The fledgling league realized they needed to capitalize on the big market of New York City and American League president [[Ban Johnson]] wanted revenge on McGraw and Brush for their antics with the Orioles.&lt;ref name=yank&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yankee Encyclopedia|author1=Gallagher, M. |author2=LeConte, W.|page=351|year=2003|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=978-1-58261-683-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So the American League moved the Orioles to New York, where the established [[National League]] Giants and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] teams were already located, over the Giants' and Dodgers' objections and despite their efforts to use their political influence within New York to prevent the move.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=yank/&gt; The team was eventually called the Highlanders due to their homefield being on [[Hilltop Park]] from 1903â€“12.  The Highlanders had a successful season in 1904 and were just one game away from winning the pennant that year. Highlanders star pitcher [[Jack Chesbro]], who had won 41 games that year (an AL record that still stands today), was pitching in the bottom of the 9th inning to their eventual [[Yankeesâ€“Red Sox rivalry|fierce rival]] the [[Boston Americans]]. One of Chesbro's [[spitball]]s got away allowing Boston to score and win the game and pennant on the [[wild pitch]]. The modern day World Series was played in 1903 between the winners of the American League and the National League, but when the Giants won the NL pennant in 1904 they refused to play Boston in the fall classic. Giants' owner Brush stated "There is nothing in the constitution or playing rules of the National League which requires its victorious club to submit its championship honors to a contest with a victorious club in a minor league."&lt;ref name=brush/&gt;  This move by the Giants made the 1905 season as the first one to have the World Series as the official matchup between the winners of the American and National Leagues.

===Two Teams, One Field===
The Giants briefly shared Hilltop Park as a home for two months in 1911 when the Polo Grounds was under reconstruction from a fire and relations between the two teams had warmed as a result. This paved way for the Highlanders to move into the new Polo Grounds in 1913. Now playing on the [[Harlem River]], a far cry from their high-altitude home, the name "Highlanders" no longer applied, and fell into disuse among the press. The media had already widely adopted the "Yankees" nickname coined by the New York Press, and in 1913 the team became officially known as the New York Yankees.

By the mid-1910s, Yankees owners Farrell and Devery had become estranged and were both in need of money. At the start of 1915, they sold the team to Colonel [[Jacob Ruppert]] and Captain [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] for $1.25 million. Ruppert inherited a brewery fortune, providing the Yankees with an owner who possessed deep pockets and a willingness to dig into them to produce a winning team by making moves such as acquiring Boston star [[Babe Ruth]] in 1918.

==First World Series meetings and eviction==
[[File:John McGraw 1924.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Giants Manager John McGraw ordered the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds. They moved to Yankee Stadium after the notice.]]

===Eviction notice and 1921 World Series===
{{main|1921 World Series}}

The home run-hitting exploits of Ruth proved so popular with the public that they began drawing more people than their landlords, the Giants. By the middle of 1920, the Giants had issued both an initial eviction notice which was soon rescinded and a temporary lease extension to the Yankees, allowing them to remain at the Polo Grounds until the end of {{mlby|1922}}, when the Giants had planned to renovate the stadium and increase seating capacity from 38,000 to 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://sabr.org/bioproj/park/58d80eca&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giants' future Hall of Fame manager [[John McGraw]] hated the Yankees' slugging style of Ruth as opposed to the strategy of the [[dead ball era]],&lt;ref name = "YGB" /&gt; and was said to have commented that the Yankees should "move to some out-of-the-way place, like Queens." Meanwhile, Ruppert's investments paid off when the Yankees won their first AL pennant in {{mlby|1921}}. This resulted in the inauguration of the heated [[Subway Series]] as previous matchups between the Giants and [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] were not referred to as Subway Series. The Yankees' matchup in the [[1921 World Series]] were none other than their landlords, the Giants. This series saw the likes of several other future Hall of Famers in addition to Ruth and McGraw including Giants players [[Dave Bancroft]], [[Frankie Frisch]], [[George Kelly (baseball)|George Kelly]] and [[Ross Youngs]] and Giants coaches [[Jesse Burkett]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Hughie Jennings]], while [[Miller Huggins]] and [[Home Run Baker]] rounded out the Yankees. This series was also the last of the experimental best-of-nine format, with the Giants winning the championship five games to the Yankees' three.

===1922 World Series: McGraw's last win===
{{main|1922 World Series}}

In 1922, the Yankees returned to the [[1922 World Series|World Series]], losing again to the [[1922 New York Giants season|Giants]] for the second straight year. The Giants showed talents from their previous year in addition to eventual Hall of Fame player [[Travis Jackson]]. There was also a Giants player who would become a Hall of Fame manager for the Yankees, [[Casey Stengel]]. The Yankees themselves saw the addition of a future Hall of Famer to their team in pitcher [[Waite Hoyt]]. The series was known to be controversial as it had the third and final tie game in World Series history when the game was called because of darkness. Conspiratorial allegations of impropriety of ticket sales had surfaced as a result of the game being called, causing Commissioner Landis to order proceeds to go to charities funding reconstruction efforts of World War I.

Meanwhile, the Yankees had broken ground for a new ballpark in the Bronx, right across the Harlem River from the Polo Grounds. The construction crew moved with remarkable speed and finished the new ballpark in less than a year.

==Yankees move to the Bronx==

===1923 World Series: Yankees First World Series Championship===
{{main|1923 World Series}}
The Yankees moved from Manhattan borough to Bronx with the opening of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] where, with their star [[Babe Ruth]], they drew larger crowds than ever before. Their first year saw Ruth and future Hall of Famer [[Herb Pennock]] lead them to win their first World Series ever over none other than the Giants. Between the two teams there were three rookies who would eventually be inducted into the Hall of Fame but who did not play in the series: [[Bill Terry]] and [[Hack Wilson]] for the Giants and [[Lou Gehrig]] for the Yankees.

===1936 World Series: New Legends Born===
{{main|1936 World Series}}

The teams went on to meet again in the fall classic over a decade later. Ruth had retired from baseball two years earlier and this was [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s first. Giants Hall of Fame pitcher [[Carl Hubbell]] had won the first game for the Giants, but the Yankees rallied behind future Hall of Famers management of [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] and the players [[Bill Dickey]], [[Lefty Gomez]], [[Tony Lazzeri]], [[Red Ruffing]] and newly acquired left fielder [[Jake Powell]]'s .455 avg, 10 hits, 8 runs and 4 walks to overwhelm Hubbell, Jackson and Giants legend [[Mel Ott]] to win the series 4 games to 2.

===1937 World Series: Legends Last Hurrahs===
{{main|1937 World Series}}
Both teams met again this year in the classic. It was Gehrig's last outstanding season before [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) deteriorated his career. Gehrig's last World Series home run would be in this series off of Carl Hubbell in Hubbell's last ever inning pitched in the World Series. The Yankees became the first team in history to not commit any errors the entire series and eventually passed the Boston Red Sox and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] for the most World Series wins, second only to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] at the time.

When Gehrig retired, he received gifts from the Giants organization. In his famous farewell speech two years later spoke of the rivalry:

{{quote|When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift â€“ that's something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lougehrig.com/about/speech.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907071610/http://www.lougehrig.com/about/speech.htm |archivedate=2009-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mel Allen===
{{main|Mel Allen}}

In June 1939, announcer [[Mel Allen]] was hired by both teams to conduct play by play radio broadcasts. Allen was able to be the voice of broadcasts for both teams due to only home games being broadcast at the time. Allen would continue to broadcast for both the Giants and the Yankees until his entry into World War II in 1941. Upon his return, Allen only did Yankee broadcasts full-time up until 1964.

===1951 World Series: The Last Giants&amp;ndash;Yankees Subway Series, Passing of the Torch===
{{main|1951 World Series}}
Both teams met again in the 1951 World Series in what was a matchup of eccentric Hall of Fame managers. [[Leo Durocher]] of the Giants had led the Giants to the fall classic over [[Bobby Thomson]]'s famous [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]] home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Yankees had former Giants player Casey Stengel managing them. The Series would be the last for Joe DiMaggio and the first for the legendary Hall of Famers [[Mickey Mantle]] and [[Willie Mays]]. Several other [[Major League Baseball All Star Game|All-Stars]] played, including [[Jim Hearn]], [[Sal Maglie]], [[Larry Jansen]], [[Whitey Lockman]], [[Alvin Dark]] and future Hall of Famer [[Monte Irvin]] for the Giants while [[Allie Reynolds]], [[Vic Raschi]], [[Gil McDougald]], [[Eddie Lopat]] and future Hall of Famer [[Phil Rizzuto]] wore Yankee pinstripes.

The series proved to be the last Subway Series between the two clubs.

The Giants would bounce back in {{wsy|1954}} to win the World Series over the [[Cleveland Indians]] in one of the finest seasons for a team. That would be their last World Series win in New York as well as franchise history up until {{wsy|2010}}.

==Giants leave New York for San Francisco==
The Giants had been contemplating a move from New York when they were seeking a new stadium away from the crumbling Polo Grounds. Initially, Giants ownership was thinking of moving to [[Minnesota]]. However, San Francisco had its [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]] at the time, [[George Christopher]], approach the Giants about relocation to San Francisco. Brooklyn Dodgers owner [[Walter O'Malley]] had already been in negotiations with the city of Los Angeles to move the Dodgers there. MLB would not authorize the move unless a second team would also move to [[California]]. In an effort to preserve their fierce [[Dodgersâ€“Giants rivalry|rivalry]], majority owner [[Horace Stoneham]] caved in and announced the move.

[[Joan Whitney Payson]] and [[M. Donald Grant]] were the only members of the Giants' ownership board who objected. They both eventually would become part of the ownership of the new New York baseball team 5 years later, the [[New York Mets]], who would adopt the Giants' orange interlocking NY logo and their orange trim (mingled with royal blue from the Dodgers).

===1962 World Series: The rivalry goes cross-country===
{{main|1962 World Series}}
The Yankees and Giants met for their first World Series in 1962 since the Giants had left. The series was closely contested by both teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jgEtGJQ040C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=yankees+giants+rivalry#v=onepage&amp;q=yankees%20giants%20rivalry&amp;f=false|title=Yankees century: 100 years of New York Yankees baseball|page=290|first=Dick|last=Johnson|first2=Glenn|last2=Stout|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-08527-0|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants had better statistics in ERA, batting average (where the Yankees had one of the worst post season averages ever)&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8522562/mlb-playoffs-2012-alex-rodriguez-says-back-new-york-yankees-next-season&lt;/ref&gt; and all categories of extra base hits yet wound up losing the series in 7 games. It was remembered for a then record 13-day series due to excessive rainfall in both cities. Hall of Famers [[Yogi Berra]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Juan Marichal]] and [[Willie McCovey]] joined Mantle and Mays in the rivalry. The final game featured a good defensive play by [[Roger Maris]], who had just broken Babe Ruth's single season home run record the year prior. With the Yankees leading 1-0 and [[Matty Alou]] on first, Willie Mays doubled toward the right-field line. Maris cut off the ball and made a strong throw to prevent Alou from scoring the tying run; the play set up Willie McCovey's series-ending line drive to second baseman [[Bobby Richardson]] in what would be their last world series matchup to date.

==Recent developments and Interleague play==

Since [[Interleague play]] started, the teams have had limited meetings. The Yankees visited newly built [[Pac Bell Park]] in March 2000 for a preseason series marking their first visit to San Francisco in 38 years. June 6, 2002 saw the first meeting between the two clubs since the 1962 World Series. The Giants had come back to play at the old [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Future home run king [[Barry Bonds]] remarked how he wanted to touch something of the Babe's as a respect for the history there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-120284214/giants-yankees-finally-meet.html Giants, Yankees finally meet again at Yankee Stadium.] San Jose Mercury News, Posted June 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds would hit a home run to eventually obtain the record of being the only player in MLB history to have hit in all existing baseball stadiums during his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/437804-barry-bonds-historic-blast-at-yankee-stadium Barry Bonds' Historic Blast at Yankee Stadium] bleacherreport.com Retrieved August 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

May 28, 2006 saw Bonds pass Ruth on the all time home run list as he hit his career number 715 off [[Colorado Rockies]] pitcher [[Byung-hyun Kim]] (who himself has a history with the Yankees giving up two walk off home runs to them in the [[2001 World Series]] when he was with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260528126|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-05-28|title=Bonds' milestone homer not enough vs. Rockies|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/gamecenter/recap/MLB_20060528_COL@SF |accessdate=2007-09-29 |date=2006-05-28 |title=Bonds hits No. 715, passes Ruth as Giants fall to Rockies |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |author=Miller, Scott |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108070109/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/gamecenter/recap/MLB_20060528_COL@SF |archivedate=2007-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds would also break another record once held by Ruth, and then later by Maris, of the most home runs hit in a single season when he won away the award from St. Louis Cardinal slugger [[Mark McGwire]] who had done so in 1998. Bonds would finish his career with 1,996 RBI, one ahead of legendary Yankee Lou Gehrig.

Years later, the Giants hosted the Yankees at [[AT&amp;T Park]] for the first time ever and won the series that included Bonds, [[Roger Clemens]], [[Mariano Rivera]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Alex Rodriguez]]. Former Yankee hero [[Dave Righetti]] was the Giants pitching coach for the series that saw Bonds hit his 749th home run as he eventually moved towards becoming the all-time home run king. Both of these series had the Yankees managed by [[Joe Torre]], a Brooklyn native who was a Giants fan growing up when they were still in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/21532095/ns/sports-baseball/print/1/displaymode/1098/|title=Dodgers make it official, hire Torre|date=November 1, 2007|agency=Associated Press|work=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Jeter passed Mel Ott for the most hits for a New York-based team. Later that month, Jeter went on to tie Bonds for getting 10 HRs and 10 [[stolen base]]s for 15 years straight.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/5287/will-jeter-tie-bonds-in-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, Alex Rodriguez joined Bonds and Willie Mays as the only players to ever hit 600 home runs and steal 300 bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=5448417&amp;type=story|title=Moseley is no overnight sensation|date=August 8, 2010|first=Wallace|last=Matthews|work=ESPNNewYork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Jeter passed Bonds on the [[List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders|all-time hits list]].

The Yankees hosted the Giants for the first time at the new [[Yankee Stadium]] in September 2013. Alex Rodriguez became the all-time grand slam leader when he hit his career 24th against the Giants on September 20, 2013. Two days later, the Yankees honored Mariano Rivera for his career and retired his number. Metal band [[Metallica]] played their famous song ''[[Enter Sandman]]'' as part of the ceremony due to Rivera using it as his entrance song throughout his career. Dave Righetti, who previously held the Yankees all-time saves record prior to Rivera, and other former Yankees on the Giants coaching staff presented Rivera with an electric guitar designed by Metallica with the Yankees logo and Giants logo surrounding Rivera's #42 and signed by Willie Mays. Prior to the series, long time Yankees legend [[Andy Pettitte]] announced he would retire after the season. Pettitte started the game for the Yankees and threw several innings of [[Perfect game|perfect]] baseball, but it would not be enough as the Giants would deflate the Yankees festivities of the day by going on to win the game 2-1.

The Yankees most recent championship was a victory during the [[2009 World Series]]. This was the team's first and, to date, only championship in their new stadium. The [[2010 World Series|following year]], the Giants made a historic run to win their first World Series in San Francisco led by [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] catcher [[Buster Posey]]. Posey and the Giants would win again in the [[2012 World Series]] and the [[2014 World Series]]. Derek Jeter's initial impact and multiple world championships early on in his career drew comparisons of him to Buster Posey.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11721619/is-buster-posey-next-derek-jeter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/10/19/as-jeter-exits-the-possible-new-face-of-baseball-wears-a-mask/ | work=New York Post | first=Joel | last=Sherman | title=As Jeter exits, the possible new face of baseball wears a mask | date=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent series between the Giants and Yankees occurred the weekend of July 22â€“24, 2016 at Yankee Stadium with the Yankees taking the series 2-1.

The Giants and Yankees will meet on the weekend of April 26-28, 2019 at the Giants newly named [[Oracle Park]], the first time the Yankees visit the Giants in San Francisco since 2007.

'''Major League Baseball''' ('''MLB''') is a [[professional baseball]] organization and the oldest of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]. A total of 30 teams play in the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), with 15 teams in each league. The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901, respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities beginning in 1903, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the [[Commissioner of Baseball]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=2000nl&gt;{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 2000 National League|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|website=Baseball-Almanac.com|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=BASEBALL; League Presidents Out As Baseball Centralizes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/sports/baseball-league-presidents-out-as-baseball-centralizes.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 1999|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also oversees [[Minor League Baseball]], which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the major league clubs. With the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], MLB manages the international [[World Baseball Classic]] tournament.

Baseball's first openly all-professional team was founded in [[Cincinnati]] in 1869. (Previously, some teams had paid some players under the table.) The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another.

The period before 1920 in baseball is known as the [[dead-ball era]], during which players would rarely hit [[home run]]s. In the late 1910s, baseball survived a conspiracy to [[match fixing|fix]] the [[1919 World Series]], which came to be known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. Shortly after the war, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke [[baseball color line|baseball's color barrier]].

The 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the [[Mitchell Report]], which implicated many players in the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing substances]], including at least one player from each team.

Today, MLB is composed of [[Current Major League Baseball franchises|30 teams]]: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance to a four-round [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason tournament]] that culminates in the [[World Series]], a [[best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries throughout the world. MLB has the [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues|highest season attendance]] of any sports league in the world with more than 69.6 million spectators in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2018/10/03/how-mlb-attendance-dropped-below-70-million-for-first-time-in-15-years/#7b44d74d61bf|title=Why MLB Attendance Dropped Below 70 Million For The First Time In 15 Years|last1=Brown|first1=Maury|date=October 3, 2018|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
MLB is governed by the [[Major League Baseball Constitution]]. This document has undergone several incarnations since its creation in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berg|first1=Ted|title=Someone is selling MLB's original 1876 constitution, and it's expected to fetch millions|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/mlb-original-constitution-national-league-base-ball-sale-auction|website=USAToday.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017|date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], MLB hires and maintains the sport's [[umpire (baseball)|umpiring]] crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television contracts]]. MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of [[Minor League Baseball]]. This is due in large part to the 1922 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', which held that baseball is not [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] and therefore not subject to federal [[antitrust]] law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?" /&gt; The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/baseball.html|title=Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?|accessdate=September 4, 2008|publisher=www.swlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective|title=The Role of Antitrust Laws in the Professional Sports Industry From a Financial Perspective|accessdate=September 4, 2008|work=Howard Bartee, Jr|publisher=The Sport Journal |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094652/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective|archivedate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the [[Federal League]] in 1916; the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted [[Continental League]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?" /&gt;

The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, currently [[Rob Manfred]]. The [[chief operating officer]] is [[Tony Petitti]]. There are five other executives: president (business and media), chief communications officer, chief legal officer, chief financial officer, and chief baseball officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8023312/major-league-baseball-executive-jimmie-lee-solomon-resigns-21-years|title=Manfred promoted; Jimmie Lee Solomon resigns|publisher=ESPN|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=execs&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Executives|website=[[MLB.com]]|year=2013|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in [[Manhattan]], is [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]]. This branch oversees [[MLB.com]] and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds [[editorial independence]] from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of [[MLB Network]], with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider [[DirecTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network|title=MLB Network|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates out of studios in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and also has editorial independence from the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network/about/|title=About MLB Network|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==League organization==
In 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Commissionership: A Historical Perspective|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1901 to 1960, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.

In the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the [[Montreal Expos]]). Two teams (the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. In 1993, the National League expanded with two teams, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies, to even up the number of teams in both leagues.  A third division, the Central Division, was formed in each league in 1994. Until 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997.&lt;ref name=Interleague&gt;{{cite news|title=Interleague play ho-hum to some|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HjMfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=388EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2778,783864|accessdate=November 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|date=June 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995 two new franchises, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known as the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]), were awarded by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with five in each division), but in order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994â€“98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league. At the same time, the [[Detroit Tigers]] agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee), with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html|title=Brewers switch leagues, join Reds in NL Central|work=[[The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]])|publisher=[[E.

In 2000 the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, and MLB became a single, overall league ''de jure'', similar to the [[National Football League]] (NFL), [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)â€”albeit with two components called "leagues" instead of "conferences." The same [[Baseball rules|rules]] and [[regulation of sport|regulations]] are used in both leagues, with one exception: the AL operates under the [[designated hitter]] rule, while the NL does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designated Hitter Rule|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/designated-hitter-rule|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last=Adamson|first=Scott|title=Nothing more irritating than playing by one set of rules in one park and a different set in another|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2011/jul/01/nothing-more-irritating-playing-one-set-rules-one/|newspaper=[[The Anderson Independent-Mail]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014147/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2011/jul/01/nothing-more-irritating-playing-one-set-rules-one/|archivedate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in rules between leagues is unique to MLB; the other sports leagues of the U.S. and Canada have one set of rules for all teams.

==History==
{{Main|History of baseball in the United States}}

===Founding===
In the 1860s, aided by soldiers playing the game in camp during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball's first governing body, [[History of baseball in the United States|The National Association of Base Ball Players]]. The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For [[professional baseball]]'s founding year, MLB uses the year 1869â€”when the first professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1869reds.com/history/|title=Legend of the Cincinnati Red Stockings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175805/http://www.1869reds.com/history|archivedate=July 24, 2008|website=1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings Vintage Base Ball Team|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. The [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], often known as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871.&lt;ref name="base ball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404475/National-Association-of-Professional-Base-Ball-Players|title=National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.&lt;ref name=Rader&gt;{{cite book|last=Rader|first=Benjamin|title=Baseball: A History of America's Game|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0-252-07550-6|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jplRWwEmVIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=nabbp+baseball#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=Spatz&gt;{{cite book|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|title=Historical Dictionary of Baseball|year=2012|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=978-0-8108-7954-6|page=236|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ViiCha8LoBgC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=cubs+braves+napbbp#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the [[National League]] or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NLâ€”on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the [[Jefferson Street Grounds]], Philadelphia)â€”is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.&lt;ref name=noble&gt;{{cite news|first=Marty|last=Noble|title=MLB carries on strong, 200,000 games later: Look what they started on a ballfield in Philadelphia in 1876|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&amp;content_id=25060814&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|date=September 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201192845/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&amp;content_id=25060814&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|archivedate=February 1, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1876/04221876.htm Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876].

The early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882â€“1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship seriesâ€”the first attempt at a [[World Series]]. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the [[American League]] in 1901 under AL president [[Ban Johnson]], and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.

The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.&lt;ref name="hotel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[MiLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the NA continues to this day (known as [[Minor League Baseball]]), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by [[Branch Rickey]].&lt;ref name="nabpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|title=1903 National Agreement|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues. These include the AA, the [[Union Association]] (1884),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/American_Association_(19th_Century)|title=American Association (19th Century)|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Players' League]] (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/PL/1890.shtml|title=1890 Players' League|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal League]] (1914â€“1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1914.shtml|title=1914 Federal League|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1915.shtml|title=1915 Federal League|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the UA and AA are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers{{who|date=October 2015}} because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. Some researchers, including [[Nate Silver]], dispute the major-league status of the UA by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately "stacked"; the St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only club that was close to major-league caliber.&lt;ref name="union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324|title=NerdFight: League Quality Adjustments|publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Silver, Nate|year=2007|authorlink=Nate Silver |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212060727/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324|archivedate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead-ball era===
{{Main|Dead-ball era}}
[[File:T205 Cy Young.jpg|thumb|upright|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]
The period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly referred to as the "Dead-Ball Era." Games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Mordecai Brown]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly, affecting the distance that it would travel.&lt;ref name=McNeil&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The Evolution of Pitching in Major League Baseball|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2468-0|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ODvYhwnhn0C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=deadball+era+yarn#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, balls were kept in play until they were mangled, soft and sometimes lopsided. During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}}}} today (in [[inflation]]-adjusted [[U.S. dollars]]), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball.&lt;ref name=Keating&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Peter|title=The game that Ruth built|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918184533/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/|archivedate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the [[spitball]]. (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a [[grandfather clause]]). Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the [[West Side Grounds]] of the Chicago Cubs, which was {{convert|560|ft}} to the center field fence, and the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], which was {{convert|635|ft}} to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and "small ball" tactics such as [[single (baseball)|singles]], [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, and the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run]] play dominated the strategies of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) "The Ultimate Baseball Book", Houghton Mifflin Books, {{ISBN|0-618-05668-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mAbGN_1cmhcC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq="inside+baseball" p. 33].&lt;/ref&gt; Hitting methods like the [[Baltimore Chop]] were used to increase the number of infield singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Burt|last=Solomon|date=1999|title=Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-684-85917-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooF5NtRmJbwC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.&lt;ref name=Lieb&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieb|first=Fred|title=The Baltimore Orioles: The History of a Colorful Team in Baltimore and St. Louis|year=1955|publisher=[[SIU Press]]|isbn=0-8093-8972-X|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BahcUaZZebYC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22baltimore+chop%22#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Foul_strike_rule Foul strike rule]. [[Baseball-Reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1919 World Series]] between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a [[game fixing]] scheme known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. Eight playersâ€”[[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]], [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Lefty Williams|Claude "Lefty" Williams]], [[Buck Weaver|George "Buck" Weaver]], [[Chick Gandil|Arnold "Chick" Gandil]], [[Fred McMullin]], [[Swede Risberg|Charles "Swede" Risberg]], and [[Happy Felsch|Oscar "Happy" Felsch]]â€”intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth $100,000 ($1,064,705.88 in 2016 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html|title=History Files â€“ Chicago Black Sox: The Fix|publisher=[[Chicago History Museum]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184407/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|title=History Files â€“ Chicago Black Sox|publisher=[[Chicago History Museum]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815042229/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|archivedate=August 15, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in popularity===
Baseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season was notable for the death of [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the "dead-ball" era to an end. The following year, the [[New York Yankees]] made their first World Series appearance.&lt;ref name=Plaque&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians uncover lost Chapman plaque|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2818187|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=October 31, 2013|date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World Series, winning eight of them.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Yankees: Team History and Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankees slugger [[Babe Ruth]] had set the single season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs.&lt;ref name=Swat&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The King of Swat: An Analysis of Baseball's Home Run Hitters from the Major, Minor, Negro, and Japanese Leagues|year=1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0362-4|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=inW5x6SDgkYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=babe+ruth+ned+williamson#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected by the difficulties of the [[Great Depression]], baseball's popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their [[Major League Baseball rosters|rosters]] from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, no MLB teams moved or folded.&lt;ref name=Belson&gt;{{cite news|last=Belson|first=Ken|title=Apples for a Nickel, and Plenty of Empty Seats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/sports/baseball/07depression.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II era===
The onset of World War II created a significant shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and those with a military classification of [[4F (military conscription)|4F]], indicating mental, physical, or moral unsuitability for service. Men like [[Pete Gray]], a one-armed outfielder, got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war.&lt;ref name=War&gt;{{cite book|last=Anton|first=Todd and Bill Nowlin (eds.)|title=When Baseball Went to War|year=2008|publisher=[[Triumph Books]]|isbn=978-1-60078-126-1|pages=7â€“9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYovAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baseball+world+war+II#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black players, many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing [[Negro league baseball]].&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Alfred|title=The Negro Leagues in New Jersey: A History|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5192-0|pages=104â€“105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FV0uF_RwC00C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=negro+leagues+world+war+II#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blackout (wartime)|Wartime blackout restrictions]], designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be canceled.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] wrote a letter to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, "I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, Franklin. "Green Light Letter". January 15, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of stars including [[Stan Musial]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Ted Williams]], and [[Joe DiMaggio]], but baseball clubs continued to field their teams.&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Robert|title=Three Reichs, You're Out|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/04/baseball_in_world_war_ii_the_amazing_story_of_the_u_s_military_s_integrated.html|publisher=[[Slate.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaking the color barrier===
{{Main|Baseball color line}}
Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected [[Jackie Robinson]] from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the [[Montreal Royals]], for the 1946 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|title=The Jackie Robinson Foundation|publisher=[[Jackie Robinson Foundation]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628015406/http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|archivedate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed his team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp;|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/35d925c7|title=Leo Durocher|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a strike threat by some players, NL President [[Ford Frick]] and Baseball Commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players, including Dodgers teammate [[Pee Wee Reese]] who said, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070412&amp;content_id=1895445&amp;vkey=perspectives&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=1947: A time for change|accessdate=September 12, 2009|last=Newman|first=Mark|date=April 13, 2007|website=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Robinson won the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award]] (separate NL and AL Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).&lt;ref name=ROY&gt;''Rookie of the Year Awards &amp; Rolaids Relief Award Winners''.

MLB banned the signing of women to contracts in 1952, but that ban was lifted in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/848071-are-women-the-next-demographic-to-integrate-into-major-league-baseball|title=Are Women the Next Demographic to Integrate into Major League Baseball?|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2019, there have been no female MLB players.

===Expanding west, south and north===
{{Main|Major League Baseball relocation of 1950sâ€“1960s}}
[[File:Dodger Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Dodger Stadium]] in 2007]]
From 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues. The 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: New York City had three teams and [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis]] each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. In 1953, the NL's Boston Braves became the [[Milwaukee Braves]]. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In 1955, the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] became the [[Kansas City Athletics]].

Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' boss [[Walter O'Malley]] to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&amp;content_id=5714&amp;vkey=hof_pr|title=Veterans elect five into Hall of Fame: Two managers, three executives comprise Class of 2008|accessdate=January 19, 2008|publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]|date=December 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204185637/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&amp;content_id=5714&amp;vkey=hof_pr|archivedate=December 4, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[1958 Major League Baseball season]], he moved the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=FYOL /&gt; When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn, he appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19580428,00.html|title=Walter O'Malley|accessdate=April 28, 2008|date=April 28, 1958|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Malley was also influential in persuading the rival [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] to move west to become the San Francisco Giants.

In 1961, the first [[History of the Washington Senators|Washington Senators]] franchise moved to [[Minneapolis â€“ Saint Paul|Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul]] to become the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the [[Los Angeles Angels]] (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]) and a new [[Washington Senators (1961â€“1971)|Washington Senators]] franchise. The NL added the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[New York Mets]] in 1962. The Astros (known as the "Colt .45s" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the [[Louisville Colonels]] folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the [[Gulf Coast]]. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40â€“120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capitalâ€”and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaignsâ€”but in their eighth season ([[1969 New York Mets season|1969]]) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to play in the postseason, culminating in a World Series title over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.

In 1966, the major leagues moved to the "Deep South" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In 1969, the American and National Leagues both [[1969 Major League Baseball expansion|added two expansion franchises]]. The American League added the [[Seattle Pilots]] (who became the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]], as well as the [[San Diego Padres]].

In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the [[Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex]] to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. In 1977, baseball [[1977 Major League Baseball expansion|expanded again]], adding a second Canadian team, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], as well as the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Subsequently, no new teams were added until the 1990s and no teams moved until 2005.

===Pitching dominance and rule changes===
[[File:MLB runs.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Graph showing, by year, the average number of runs per MLB game]]
By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968â€”later nicknamed "the year of the pitcher"&lt;ref name="yearofthepitcher"&gt;"[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1998/08/04/1968_pitchers/ 1968 â€“ The Year of the Pitcher]" ''Sports Illustrated'', August 4, 1998. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521002248/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1998/08/04/1968_pitchers/ |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;â€”Boston Red Sox player [[Carl Yastrzemski]] won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in the history of Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name="yaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg3.shtml|title=Year by Year Leaders for Batting Average|accessdate=September 8, 2008|publisher=baseball-almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games, making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since [[Dizzy Dean]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="denny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=162|title=When Denny McLain stood baseball on its ear|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Bailey, Mary|year=2000|work=The Detroit News |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090113182959/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=162|archivedate=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of just 1.12.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsobo01.shtml|title=Bob Gibson Statistics|accessdate=September 8, 2008|publisher=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches, beginning in the 1969 season.&lt;ref name="mound"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm|title=From Mountain To Molehill|accessdate=March 9, 2009|author=William Leggett|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 24, 1969 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826001422/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm|archivedate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule.&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html|title=Blomberg first permanent pinch-hitter|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Merron, Jeff|year=2003|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New stadiums and artificial surfaces===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, [[National Football League|NFL]] football had been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities to build [[multi-purpose stadium]]s instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from [[artificial turf]], as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=October 13, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024070428/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|archivedate=October 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more [[foul territory]] than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.

Teams began to be built around pitchingâ€”particularly their bullpensâ€”and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit [[ground ball]]s "[[in the hole]]" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw [[complete game]]s; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6â€“7 innings and turn the game over to the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]], a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After [[Willie Mays]] hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ([[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]) reached that mark until the 1990s.

===Scandals and a changing game===
During the 1980s, baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years. Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade, with players hitting only 40 home runs just 13 times and no one hitting more than 50 home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead-ball era (1900â€”1919).&lt;ref name="parade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/408556/parade/1980s-the-decade-baseballs-innocence-ended/|title=1980s: The Decade Baseball's Innocence Ended|date=July 3, 2015|publisher=Parade Magazine|author=Gammons, Peter|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SABR80s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/baseball-s-forgotten-era-80s|title=1Baseball's Forgotten Era: The '80s|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)|author=Dâ€™Addona, Dan|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams instead focused on building their rosters around speed and defense.

The [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]] from June 12 until July 31 forced the cancellation of 713 total games and resulted in a split-season format.

In 1985, [[Pete Rose]] broke [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, and in 1989 Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Rose was the first person to receive a lifetime ban from baseball since 1943.&lt;ref name="parade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-24/news/mn-1531_1_pete-rose|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Pete Rose Banned for Life : Giamatti Says He Bet on Games; Appeal Possible in Year|date=August 24, 1989|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1985 also saw the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] which involved players who were called to testify before a grand jury in Pittsburgh related to cocaine trafficking. Eleven players were officially suspended, but all the suspensions were commuted in exchange for fines, drug testing, and community service.

===Steroid era, further expansion and near contraction===
Routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using [[Doping in baseball|steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs]].

In 1993, the NL added the [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami area]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]] in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in Phoenix and the American League's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

After the 2001 season, the team owners [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|voted in favor of contraction]]. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.&lt;ref name=Plans&gt;{{cite web|title=Plans involving Angels and A's never seriously considered|url=http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/news/2003/0311/1522058.html|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to Washington after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team.

==Uniforms==
{{Main|Major League Baseball uniforms|Baseball uniform}}
[[File:Baseball1870s.jpg|thumb|A baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870s. Note that the team is integrated, in contrast to 20th century MLB, which was segregated until 1947.]]
A [[baseball uniform]] is a type of uniform worn by [[position player|baseball players]], and by some non-playing personnel, such as [[Manager (baseball)|field managers]] and coaches. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game andâ€”through the use of logos, colors, and [[uniform number (Major League Baseball)|numbers]]â€”to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907|title=History of Baseball Uniforms|work=Americanchronicle.com|accessdate=June 13, 2011|first=Robert|last=Riles|date=April 8, 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816040243/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907|archivedate=August 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams using their team name on both uniforms.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/|title=MLB Logos|publisher=[[SportsLogos.net]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams also have one or more [[third jersey|alternate uniforms]], usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; In the past few decades [[throwback uniform]]s have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/MLB-teams-wear-throwback-uniforms-for-select-games-in-2011-051711#photo-title=Retired+attire&amp;photo=29811636|title=MLB tems wear throwback uniforms for select games in 2011|publisher=FOX Sports|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white [[flannel]] shirts ([[Jersey (sport)|jerseys]]) and [[straw hat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19cbaseball.com/sessearch.php?q=uniforms|title=Date when the New York Knickerbockers wore the first baseball uniforms and what they were made of|publisher=iterpret.co.za|accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interpret.co.za/art/Recreation-and-Sport/Baseball/history_of_baseball_uniforms_in_the_major_leagues.php|title=History Of Baseball Uniforms In The Major Leagues|publisher=interpret.co.za|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/introduction.htm|title=The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[baseball cap|Caps]] and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55808234.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019185654/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55808234.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 19, 2012|title=A short history of the baseball cap.(The Home Forum) â€“ The Christian Science Monitor&amp;nbsp;â€” HighBeam Research|publisher=www.highbeam.com|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3660333.stm|title=Happy 50th, baseball caps|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 2, 2008|date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070827&amp;content_id=2174187&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Celebrating the rich history of baseball caps|publisher=mlb.mlb.com|accessdate=June 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1882 uniform rules, players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played.&lt;ref name="The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/timeline_1882.htm|title=The history of the baseball uniform at the National Baseball Hall of Fame|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s, the [[Detroit Wolverines]] and [[Washington Nationals (1886â€“89)|Washington Nationals]] of the [[National League]] and the [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]] of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm|title=National Baseball Hall of Fame&amp;nbsp;â€” Dressed to the Nines&amp;nbsp;â€” Uniform Database|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=May 2, 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411043828/http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm|archivedate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own [[Baseball park|baseball stadium]] and a different one for when they played away ([[Road game|on the road]]) at the other team's ballpark.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away.&lt;ref name="MLB Uniforms" /&gt; By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues.&lt;ref name=BAuni&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Uniforms|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season structure==
{{Main|Major League Baseball schedule|List of Major League Baseball seasons}}

===Spring training===
{{Main|Spring training}}
[[File:Spring training.jpg|thumb|A Grapefruit League game at the former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] camp in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], Florida]]
[[Spring training]] is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the [[Cactus League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the [[Grapefruit League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.

Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular season===
Each team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at [[Night game#Baseball|night]]. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.

Each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague "natural rival" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.

With an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the [[home advantage|home team's]] league rules. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have [[#League organization|15 teams]].)

Over the course of a season, teams compete for the five [[Playoffs|playoff]] berths in their respective leagues. In order to secure a berth, a team must either win its [[MLB#League organization|division]], or capture a [[MLB Wild Card|wild card spot]] by having one of the two best records among the non-winners in its entire league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130930|title=MLB: Regular Season|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the 162-game season, an additional [[One-game playoff|tie-breaking]] game (or games) may be needed to determine [[MLB postseason|postseason]] participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130904&amp;content_id=59527184&amp;c_id=mlb|title=How to determine playoff tiebreakers|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=|date=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-to-mid July, just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. The All-Star Game features a team of players from the American League (AL)â€”led by the manager of the previous AL World Series teamâ€”and a team of players from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1962, two games were held each season, one was held in July and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/sports/baseball/29bats.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Rosters Expanded For the All-Star Game|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official All-Star Game was held as part of the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]] in Chicago, Illinois, and was the idea of [[Arch Ward]], then sports editor for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name = asgmenu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game History|accessdate=|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060710&amp;content_id=1550905&amp;vkey=allstar2006&amp;fext=.jsp|last=Newman|first=Mark|title=All-Star MVP Awaits Your Vote|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=July 10, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1970, it was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy, until 1985, when the name change was reversed. In 2002, it was renamed the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award]].)

Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans.&lt;ref name = asgmenu/&gt; The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and [[Hank Aaron]]. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.

The [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 contest in Milwaukee]] controversially ended in an 11-inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers. In response, starting in 2003 the league which wins the All-Star game received home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosted the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain home-field advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2003_WS.shtml|title=2003 World Series (4â€“2): Florida Marlins (91â€“71) over New York Yankees (101â€“61)|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/20036WS.shtml|title=2006 World Series (4â€“1): St. Louis Cardinals (83â€“78) over Detroit Tigers (95â€“67)|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was discontinued after the 2016 season.

MLB All-Stars from both leagues have worn uniforms from their respective teams at the game with one exception. In the [[1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1933 All-Star Game]], the National League All-Star Team members wore special gray uniforms with "National League" written in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey.&lt;ref name="The World Series and Highlights of Baseball"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamont|first=Buchanan|title=The World Series and Highlights of Baseball|publisher=E.

When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), ten teams enter the postseason playoffs. These ten teams consist of six teams that are division champions by earning the best regular season overall [[winning percentage|win-loss record]] for their respective divisions, and four who are "wild-card" teams that are each one of two teams in their respective leagues who have earned the best regular season win-loss record, but are not division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:

# [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], a one-game playoff between the two wild-card teams in each league.
# [[American League Division Series]] and [[National League Division Series]], each a best-of-five-games series.
# [[American League Championship Series]] and [[National League Championship Series]], each a best-of-seven-games series played between the winning teams from the Division Series. The league champions are informally referred to as the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] winners.
# [[World Series]], a best-of-seven-games series played between the pennant winners of each league.

Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and #3 seeds, based on winâ€“loss records. The team with the best record among non division winners will be the first wildcard and the #4 seed. The team with the second best record among non division winners will be the second wildcard and the #5 seed. In the wildcard round, the #5 seed will play at the #4 seed in a one-game playoff. For the division series, the matchup will be the #1 seed against the Wild Card Game winner and the #2 seed against the #3 seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1784642-mlb-playoff-format-2013-tiebreak-scenarios-wild-card-games-and-seedings|title=MLB Playoff Format 2013: Tiebreaker Scenarios, Wild Card Games and Seedings|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2017, home-field advantage in the World Series is determined by regular-season records of the two league champions, replacing a system used for the prior 14 seasons where the champion of the league that won the All-Star Game would receive home-field advantage.

Because each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance of starting the series with two wins,&lt;ref name="[[World Series]]"&gt;[[World Series]], sec. 3.2.2 (Game-by-Game), note 2; as of 2008, the 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers are the last team to win a World Series after losing the first two games on the road.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby gaining some momentum for the rest of the series.&lt;ref name="alds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&amp;content_id=1964536&amp;vkey=pressbox&amp;fext=.jsp|title=Major League Baseball announces revamped postseason schedule|accessdate=September 7, 2008|year=2007|website=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DH rule in the World Series is only used in games played at the American League Champions' home field. National League home games will play the traditional rules with each teams pitching staff batting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|title=Official Rules: 6.00 The Batter|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|MLB Japan All-Star Series|MLB Taiwan All-Star Series|MLB London Series}}
Since [[1986 MLB Japan All-Star Series|1986]] an [[all-star game|All-Star]] team from MLB is sent to a biennial end-of-the-season tour of [[Japan]], dubbed as [[MLB Japan All-Star Series]], playing exhibition games in a [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of format]] against the All-Stars from [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) or recently as of [[2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series|2014]] their national team [[Samurai Japan]].

In 2008, MLB played the [[Major League Baseball China Series|MLB China Series]] in the People's Republic of China. It was a series of two spring-training games between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. The games were an effort to popularize baseball in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-03-voa35.cfm "MLB, China Baseball League Team to Tour China", Mar. 3, 2005].

MLB played the [[MLB Taiwan All-Star Series]] in Taiwan in November 2011. It was a series of five exhibition games played by a team made up of MLB players called the MLB All-Stars and the [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team]]. The MLB All-Stars swept the series, five games to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/11/07/2003517672 "Resilient Taiwan drop All-Stars series finale 6-4"], Taipei Times, November 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2011 season, it was announced that the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics would play their season openers in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110928&amp;content_id=25337950&amp;vkey=pr_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea|title=Seattle Mariners open 2012 season in Japan vs. Oakland Athletics|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=September 28, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103233953/http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110928&amp;content_id=25337950&amp;vkey=pr_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea|archivedate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Phil Rogers of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that MLB was considering postseason all-star tours in Taiwan and Korea; baseball is increasing in popularity in both countries.&lt;ref name=Jarosh&gt;{{cite web|last=Jarosh|first=Noah|title=MLB exploring possible All-Star tour in Korea after 2014|url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/10/13/4834222/mlb-all-star-tour-2014-korea-taiwan|publisher=[[SBNation.com]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013|date=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the Red Sox were the home team in the inaugural MLB London Series, a regular season two-game series against the Yankees. The games were played on June 29â€“30 at [[London Stadium]] with the Yankees winning both games. The pair were the first regular season MLB games held in Europe. In 2020, the Cubs and Cardinals will play at the same place.

Together with the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], MLB sponsors the [[World Baseball Classic]], an international baseball tournament contested by national teams.

In 1998, both [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] hit more than the long-standing single-season MLB record of 61 home runs. [[Barry Bonds]] topped the record in 2001 with 73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds and Sosa became the subjects of speculation regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during the 1998 season.&lt;ref name=ESPNsteroids&gt;{{cite web|title=The Steroids Era|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/topics/_/page/the-steroids-era|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive test. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times per year.&lt;ref name="wnbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnbc.com/mikedup/4077510/detail.html|title=MLB Owners, Players Reach Deal On Steroid Testing|accessdate=September 6, 2008|year=2005|publisher=wnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 book, ''[[Game of Shadows]]'' by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' investigative reporters [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]], chronicled alleged extensive use of performance enhancers, including several types of steroids and [[growth hormone]] by baseball superstars Barry Bonds, [[Gary Sheffield]], and [[Jason Giambi]]. Former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] George Mitchell was appointed by Selig on March 30, 2006&lt;ref name="MLB_pre"&gt;{{cite web|first=Barry|last=Bloom|title=Mitchell Report to be released today|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071212&amp;content_id=2323307&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|work=[[MLB.com]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate the use of performance-enhancing drugs in MLB. The appointment was made after several influential members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] made negative comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's [[Major League Baseball drug policy|drug policies]] and Commissioner Selig.&lt;ref name="NYT_20071213"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Duff|last1=Wilson|first2=Michael|last2=Schmidt|title=Baseball Braces for Steroid Report From Mitchell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/sports/baseball/13mitchell.html?em&amp;ex=1197694800&amp;en=13aefc5012cd51c1&amp;ei=5087%0A|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 2011, Ramirez retired from baseball rather than face a 100-game suspension for his second positive steroid test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rays' Manny Ramirez to retire|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6310125|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=April 10, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later unretire, having the suspension dropped to 50 games, and would serve those in 2012.

{{See also|List of current Major League Baseball broadcasters}}
Several networks televise baseball games, including [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox]], ESPN, and MLB Network. Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on ''[[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox Saturday Baseball]]'' throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from May to September.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2516552|title=Fox, TBS have seven-year, $3&amp;nbsp;billion TV deal with MLB|accessdate=September 6, 2008|year=2006|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and the [[National League Championship Series]] (NLCS) in even-numbered years. Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast MLB games through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=mlbespn&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns|title=MLB extends TV agreement with ESPN through 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=[[Yahoo! Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN broadcasts ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'', ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'', ''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]'', and ''[[Baseball Tonight]]''. ESPN also has rights to the [[Home Run Derby]] at the All-Star Game each July.&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt;

[[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] airs [[Major League Baseball on TBS|Sunday afternoon regular season games]] (non-exclusive) nationally. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions; However, in 2018, the two tiebreaker games were broadcast on ESPN. it also airs exclusive coverage of the [[Division Series]] round of the playoffs.&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-07-11-hiestand-mlb_x.htm?csp=34|title=TBS drops Braves games, joins Fox in rich TV deal|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Michael Hiestand|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS carries the [[League Championship Series]] that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years.&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061017&amp;content_id=1715532&amp;vkey=ps2006news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=TBS signs on to air LCS games|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Barry M. Bloom|year=2006|website=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051702492.html|author=Dave Sheinin|date=May 18, 2007|title=MLB Network Closer to Fruition|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local broadcast television station and a local or [[regional sports network]] (RSN), though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own team networks. As Canada only contains one team, [[Sportsnet]] broadcasts Toronto Blue Jays games nationally.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays" /&gt; The channel is owned by [[Rogers Communications]], who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130322&amp;content_id=43127206&amp;notebook_id=43139768&amp;vkey=notebook_tor&amp;c_id=tor|title=Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportsnet also televises Fox's Saturday afternoon games, the All-Star Game, playoff games, and the World Series.&lt;ref name="Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sportsnet&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Information|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/about/|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, [[TSN2]] began carrying ESPN ''Sunday Night Baseball'' in Canada.&lt;ref name=TSN2&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball airs on TSN 2|url=http://www.digitalhome.ca/2011/04/espn%E2%80%99s-sunday-night-baseball-airs-on-tsn-2/|publisher=Digitalhome.ca|accessdate=November 30, 2013|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackout policy===
{{Main|Major League Baseball blackout policy}}
{{See also|Syndication exclusivity}}
[[File:MLB Blackout Areas.png|thumb|upright=1.35|MLB blackout map in the United States]]
[[File:Canadian MLB Blackout map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Canadian MLB blackout map]]
MLB has several [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/help/faq_blackout.jsp|title=Blackouts FAQ|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. [[Fox Sports Networks]] also show many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday ESPN or [[ESPN2]] game and is shown on a local station will see [[ESPNews]], or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed.&lt;ref name="Helyar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2870960|title=Singin' the 'Baseball Blackout Blues'|last=Helyar|first=John|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.

===Radio and Internet===
{{Main|Major League Baseball on the radio}}
[[ESPN Radio]] holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts ''Sunday Night Baseball'' weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2013/01/espns-star-studded-2013-sunday-night-baseball-schedule/|title=ESPN's Star-Studded 2013 Sunday Night Baseball Schedule|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN.

In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the [[New York Yankees Radio Network]]) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebaseballradio.com/NYyankeesAug.html|title=New York Yankees Radio Network|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with [[XM Satellite Radio]], which includes the channel [[MLB Network Radio]] and live play-by-play of all games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/mlbnetworkradio|title=MLB Network Radio|publisher=[[Sirius XM Radio]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams also maintain a network of stations that broadcast their games in Spanish; the former [[Montreal Expos]] broadcast their games in both English and French.

MLB games are also broadcast live on the internet. All television and radio broadcasts of games are available via subscription to [[MLB.tv]] at Major League Baseball's website, MLB.com, and radio-only broadcasts are also available via subscription to MLB.com Gameday Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/subscriptions/index.jsp?product=mlbtv&amp;affiliateId=MLBTVREDIRECT|title=MLB.tv|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio station affiliates are officially forbidden from streaming games through their Internet feeds. Blackout rules are still applied for live television broadcasts, but not radio broadcasts.

===International broadcasting===
[[ESPN Deportes]] televises many MLB games in [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name="deportes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;cha=5&amp;id=11918|title=ESPN Deportes' Multimedia Coverage of Major League Baseball All-Star Game and Events|publisher=hispanicprwire.com|accessdate=September 8, 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122085742/http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&amp;cha=5&amp;id=11918|archivedate=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WAPA-TV|Wapa 2]] airs games in [[Puerto Rico]], including spring training games and most of the World Baseball Classic games involving the team from Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=PH&gt;{{cite news|last=Santana|first=Glenn|title=Inicia el bÃ©isbol por Telemundo y Wapa|url=http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/tv/blog/glenn-santana/posts/iniciaelbeisbolportelemundoywapa-798527/|newspaper=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]|accessdate=November 30, 2013|language=Spanish|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, [[ESPN Brasil]] has exclusive rights on TV ([[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]] and ESPN+) and Internet ([[WatchESPN]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/modalidade/beisebol|title=ESPN Brasil: Beisebol|publisher=[[ESPN Brasil]]|accessdate=February 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209110133/http://espn.uol.com.br/modalidade/beisebol|archive-date=February 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Fox Sports]] also broadcasting some games.

'''Historic Dodgertown''' is a multi-sport facility in [[Vero Beach, Florida]] where athletes of all ages and skill levels have the opportunity to train, play, and stay together.  The facility which includes the historic [[Holman Stadium (Vero Beach)|Holman Stadium]] was originally created as a Navy housing base, and was transformed into the home of [[Spring Training]] for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball team.  It has since evolved into a multi-sport destination that includes an option of room and board via their on-site villas.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collier|first1=Jamal (November 14th, 2014)|title='Historic' Dodgertown still holds special place|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/101468268/historic-dodgertown-still-holds-special-place|website=MLB.com|publisher=MLB|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historic Dodgertown was originally built as a Navy housing base for all of the members of the [[Navy]] and [[Marines]] that trained at the US Naval Air Station during [[World War II]] that was located directly across the street.  When [[Branch Rickey]] began looking for a permanent spring training site in 1948 he was introduced to a large area of land in Vero Beach, Florida by Bud Holman, a local businessman, as the perfect place to host a fully contained training camp for the Major League club as well as the other 26 minor league teams.  The Dodgers and the city of Vero Beach ended up coming to an initial five-year lease agreement that included the naming of the property as "Dodger Town".  A stadium was completed in 1953.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holman Stadium Dedication|url=http://www.walteromalley.com/hist_dtown_page11.php|website=walteromalley.com|publisher=Copyright Â© 2003-2015 O'Malley Seidler Partners, LLC|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|date=19 March 2008|title=Dodgers leave Florida spring training home for Arizona|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3302513|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] eventually left Vero Beach, Florida for a new spring training home in [[Arizona]] after the 2008 spring training season ended,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Once the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] departed, Historic Dodgertown closed its doors and shut down due to financial instability. [[Minor League Baseball]] reopened the facilities and renamed it Vero Beach Sports Village. That change didn't last long as they were set to close again in 2012.

The '''National League of Professional Baseball Clubs''', known simply as the '''National League''' ('''NL'''), is the older of two leagues constituting [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NAPBBP) of 1871â€“1875 (often called simply the "National Association"), the NL is sometimes called the '''Senior Circuit''', in contrast to MLB's other league, the [[American League]], which was founded 25 years later and is called the "Junior Circuit". 

Both leagues currently have 15 teams. After two years of conflict in a "baseball war" of 1901â€“1902, the two eight-team leagues agreed in a "peace pact" to recognize each other as "major leagues", draft rules regarding player contracts, prohibiting "raiding", regulating relationships with [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]] and lower level clubs, and with each establishing a team in the nation's largest metropolis of [[New York City]], and the league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the new professional baseball championship tournament with the inaugural "[[World Series]]" that Fall of 1903, succeeding earlier similar national series in previous decades since the 1880s. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues also formalized the new World Series tournament beginning in 1905 as an arrangement between the leagues themselves. National League teams have won 49 of the 115 World Series championships contested from 1903 to 2019.

==History==

===Foundation===
By 1875, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NAPBBP, often referred to as the "National Association"), founded four years earlier, was suffering from a lack of strong authority over clubs, unsupervised scheduling, unstable membership of cities, dominance by one team (the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]]), and an extremely low entry fee ($10) that gave clubs no incentive to abide by league rules when it was inconvenient to them.

[[William Hulbert|William A. Hulbert]] (1832â€“1882), a [[Chicago]] businessman and an officer of the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870â€“89)|Chicago White Stockings]] of 1870â€“1889, approached several NA clubs with the plans for a professional league for the sport of base ball with a stronger central authority and exclusive territories in larger cities only. Additionally, Hulbert had a problem: five of his star players were threatened with expulsion from the NAPBBP because Hulbert had signed them to his club using what were considered questionable means. Hulbert had a great vested interest in creating his own league, and after recruiting St. Louis privately, four western clubs met in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in January 1876. With Hulbert speaking for the four later in New York City on February 2, 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was established with eight charter members, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/almanac----weekly/story.aspx?guid={D7AC1A0C-DAFA-42EE-A8C9-5BBB9E237651}&amp;dist=msr_1 |title=The Almanac â€“ weekly |date=January 27, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607201939/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/almanac----weekly/story.aspx?guid=%7BD7AC1A0C-DAFA-42EE-A8C9-5BBB9E237651%7D&amp;dist=msr_1 |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860â€“76)|Philadelphia Athletics]] from the NA (expelled after the 1876 season)

The National League's formation meant the end of the old National Association after only five seasons, as its remaining clubs shut down or reverted to amateur or minor league status. The only strong club from 1875 excluded in 1876 was a second one in Philadelphia, often called the [[Philadelphia White Stockings|White Stockings or later Phillies]].

The first game in National League history was played on April 22, 1876, at [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]]'s [[Jefferson Street Grounds]], at 25th &amp; Jefferson Streets, between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston baseball club. Boston won the game 6â€“5.

The new league's authority was soon tested after the first season. The Athletic and Mutual clubs fell behind in the standings and refused to make western road trips late in the season, preferring to play games against local non-league competition to recoup some of their financial losses rather than travel extensively incurring more costs. Hulbert reacted to the clubs' defiance by expelling them, an act which not only shocked baseball followers (New York and Philadelphia were the two most populous cities in the league) and the then sports world, but made it clear to clubs that league schedule commitments, a cornerstone of competition integrity, were not to be ignored.

The National League operated with only six clubs during 1877 and 1878. Over the next several years, various teams joined and left the struggling league.  By 1880, six of the eight charter members had folded.  The two remaining original NL franchises, [[Boston]] and Chicago, remain still in operation today as the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]]. When all eight participants for 1881 returned for 1882â€”the first off-season without turnover in membershipâ€”the "circuit" consisted of a zig-zag line connecting the eight cities: [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]] (near the state capital of [[Albany, New York]]), [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] ([[Massachusetts]]), [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].

In 1883, the [[New York Gothams]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] began National League play. Both teams remain in the NL today, the Phillies with their original name and city and the Gothams (later renamed Giants) now in [[San Francisco]] since 1958.

===Competition with other leagues===
The NL encountered its first strong rival organization when the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] began play in 1882. The AA played in cities where the NL did not have teams, offered Sunday games and alcoholic beverages in locales where permitted, and sold cheaper tickets everywhere (25 cents versus the NL's standard 50 cents, a hefty sum for many in 1882).

The National League and the American Association participated in a version of the [[World Series]] seven times during their ten-year coexistence.  These contests were less organized than the modern Series, lasting as few as three games and as many as fifteen, with two Series (1885 and 1890) ending in disputed ties.  The NL won four times and the AA only once, in 1886.

Starting with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in 1887, the National League began to raid the American Association for franchises to replace NL teams that folded.  This undercut the stability of the AA.

Other new leagues that rose to compete with the National League were the [[Union Association]] and the [[Players' League]]. The Union Association was established in 1884 and folded after playing only one season, its league champion [[St. Louis Maroons/Indianapolis Hoosiers|St. Louis Maroons]] joining the NL. The Players' League was established in 1890 by the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the sport's first players' union, which had failed to persuade the NL to modify its labor practices, including a [[salary cap]] and a [[reserve clause]] that bound players to their teams indefinitely.  The NL suffered many defections of star players to the Players' League, but the P.L. collapsed after one season.  The Brooklyn, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and New York franchises of the NL absorbed their Players' League counterparts.

===Expansion (1887â€“1899)===
The labor strike of 1890 hastened the downfall of the American Association.  After the 1891 season, the AA disbanded and merged with the NL, which became known legally for the next decade as the "National League and American Association". The teams now known as the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (originally Brooklyn) and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (as well as the now-defunct [[Cleveland Spiders]]) had already switched from the AA to the NL prior to 1892. With the merger, the NL absorbed the St. Louis Browns (now known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]), along with three other teams that did not survive into the 20th century (for those three teams, see [[#Partnership with the American League|Partnership with the American League]] below). While four teams that moved from the AA remain in the NL today (Pittsburgh [1887], Cincinnati [1890], Los Angeles [originally Brooklyn; 1890], and St. Louis [1892]), only two original NL franchises (1876) remain in the league: the [[Chicago Cubs]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]] (originally in Boston, and later Milwaukee). The Cubs are the only charter member to play continuously in the same city.  The other two pre-1892 teams still in the league are the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants (originally New York), both of which joined in 1883.

The National League became a 12-team circuit with monopoly status for the rest of the decade. The league became embroiled in numerous internal conflicts, not the least of which was a plan supported by some owners (and bitterly opposed by others) to form a "trust", wherein there would be one common ownership of all twelve teams. The NL used its [[monopsony]] power to force a $2,400 limit on annual player wages in 1894.

As the 20th century dawned, the NL was in trouble. Conduct among players was poor, and fistfights were a common sight at games. In addition to fighting each other, they fought with the umpires and often filled the air at games with foul language and obscenities. A game between the Orioles and Boston Beaneaters (a precursor to today's Atlanta Braves) in 1894 ended up having tragic consequences when players became engaged in a brawl and several boys in the stands of the [[South End Grounds]] started a fire. The blaze quickly got out of hand and swept through downtown Boston, destroying or damaging 100 buildings. Team owners  argued with each other and players hated the NL's $2,400 salary cap. Many teams also ran into trouble with city governments that [[blue law|forbade recreational activities on Sunday]].

[[Billy Sunday]], a prominent outfielder in the 1880s, became so disgusted with the behavior of teammates that he quit playing in 1891 to become one of America's most famous evangelical Christian preachers. Most fans appear to have felt the same way, because attendance at games was plummeting by 1900.

===Partnership with the American League===
After eight seasons as a 12-team league, the NL contracted back to eight teams for the 1900 season, eliminating its teams in [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore]], [[Cleveland Spiders|Cleveland]], [[Louisville Colonels|Louisville]] (which has never had another major league team since), and [[Washington Senators (1891â€“99)|Washington]]. This provided an opportunity for competition. Three of those cities received franchises in the newly christened American League (AL) when the minor Western League changed its name to the AL in 1900, with the approval of the NL, which regarded the AL as a lesser league since they were a party to the National Agreement. The AL declined to renew its National Agreement membership when it expired the next year, and on January 28, 1901, the AL officially declared itself a second major league in competition with the NL. By 1903, the upstart AL had placed new teams in the National League cities of [[Boston]], Chicago, New York, [[Philadelphia]], and [[St. Louis]]. Only the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates had no AL team in their markets. The AL among other things enforced a strict conduct policy among its players.

The National League at first refused to recognize the new league, but reality set in as talent and money was split between the two leagues, diluting the league and decreasing financial success. After two years of bitter contention, a new version of the National Agreement was signed in 1903. This meant formal acceptance of each league by the other as an equal partner in major-league baseball, mutual respect of player contracts, and an agreement to play a postseason championshipâ€”the [[World Series]].

Major League Baseball narrowly averted radical reorganization in November 1920. Dissatisfied with [[American League]] President and National Commission head [[Ban Johnson]], NL owners dissolved the league on November 8 during heated talks on MLB reorganization in the wake of the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. Simultaneously, three AL teams also hostile to Johnson ([[Boston Red Sox]], [[Chicago White Sox]], and [[New York Yankees]]) withdrew from the AL and joined the eight NL teams in forming a new National League; the 12th team would be whichever of the remaining five AL teams loyal to Johnson first chose to join; if none did so an expansion team would have been placed in [[Detroit]], by far the largest one-team city at that time. Four days later, on November 12, both sides met (without Johnson) and agreed to restore the two leagues and replace the ineffective National Commission with a one-man Commissioner in the person of federal Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koppett |first1=Leonard |title=Koppett's Concise History of Major League Baseball |date=2004 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |location=New York |isbn=9780786712861 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National League circuit remained unchanged from 1900 through 1952.  In 1953 the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Braves]] moved from Boston to [[Milwaukee]]; in 1966 they moved again, to [[Atlanta]]. In 1958 the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing major league baseball to the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time.

===Divisional reorganization===
The NL remained an eight-team league for over 60 years. (For the eight teams, see [[#Expansion (1887â€“1899)|Expansion (1887â€“1899)]] above, and [[#"Classic Eight"|"Classic Eight"]] below.) In 1962â€”facing competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and confronted by the [[American League]]'s unilateral expansion in 1961â€”the NL expanded by adding the [[New York Mets]] and the Houston Colt .45s. The "Colts" were renamed the [[Houston Astros]] three years later. In 1969, the league added the [[San Diego Padres]] and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]]), becoming a 12-team league for the first time since 1899.

In 1969, as a result of its expansion to 12 teams, the National Leagueâ€”which for its first 93 years had competed equally in a single groupingâ€”was reorganized into two [[division (sport)|divisions]] of six teams (respectively named the [[National League East]] and [[National League West|West]], although geographically it was more like North and South), with the division champions meeting in the [[National League Championship Series]] (an additional round of postseason competition) for the right to advance to the World Series.

In 1993 the league expanded to 14 teams, adding the [[Colorado Rockies]] and the [[Florida Marlins]] (which became the Miami Marlins shortly after the end of the 2011 season). In 1998, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] became the league's fifteenth franchise, and the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] moved from the AL to the NL, giving the NL 16 teams for the next 15 seasons.

In 1994, the league was again reorganized, into three geographical divisions (East, West and [[National League Central|Central]], all currently with five teams; from 1994 to 1997 the West had one less team, and from 1998 to 2012, the Central had one more team). A third postseason round was added at the same time: the three division champions plus a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) now advance to the preliminary [[National League Division Series]]. Due to a players' strike, however, the postseason was not actually held in 1994.

Before the 1998 season, the American League and the National League each added a fifteenth team. Because of the odd number of teams, only seven games could possibly be scheduled in each league on any given day. Thus, one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day. This would have made it difficult for scheduling, in terms of travel days and the need to end the season before October. In order for MLB officials to continue primarily intraleague play, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams, so the decision was made to move one club from the AL Central to the NL Central. Eventually, Milwaukee agreed to change leagues; the National League now had 16 teams, the American League 14 with the switch.&lt;ref&gt;For more details, see [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994â€“98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National"]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Often characterized as being a more "traditional" or "pure" league, the National League never adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule that was adopted by the American League in 1973. In theory, this means the role of the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] is greater in the National League than in the American, because the NL manager must take offense into account when making pitching substitutions and vice versa. However, this is disputed by some, such as former Detroit Tigers manager [[Jim Leyland]], who claims the American League is more difficult because AL managers are required to know exactly when to pull a pitcher, where an NL manager merely pulls his pitcher when that spot comes up in the batting order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2011/05/detroit_tigers_manager_jim_ley_12.html|title=Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland compares managing in AL and NL|author=Mayo, David|work=Mlive.com|date=May 22, 2011|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, there are fewer [[home run]]s and runs scored in the National League than in the American, due to the presence of the [[pitcher]] in the NL batting order.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  From the 1970s until the early 1990s, the use of artificial turf in place of natural grass was far more prevalent in National League ballparks than in the American League.

===Permanent interleague play===

For the first 96 years of its coexistence with the American League, National League teams faced their AL counterparts only in exhibition games or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, however, [[interleague play|interleague games]] have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. As part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the American League's designated-hitter rule is used only in games where the American League team is the home team.

In 1999, the offices of American League and National League presidents were discontinued and all authority was vested in the Commissioner's office. The leagues subsequently appointed "honorary" presidents to carry out ceremonial roles such as the awarding of league championship trophies. Additionally, the distinction between AL and NL umpires was erased, and instead all umpires were unified under MLB control. With these actions, as well as the institution of interleague play, little remains to differentiate between the two leagues besides the American League's use of the designated hitter.

By 2011, MLB had changed its policy on interleague play, deciding to schedule interleague games throughout the season rather than only during specially designated periods. This policy would allow each league to have 15 teams, with one team in each league playing an interleague game on any given day. As a condition of the sale of the Astros to [[Jim Crane]] in November 2011, the team agreed to move to the American League effective with the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;For more details, see [[Houston Astros#2012â€“present: Jim Crane era and move to the American League]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 2018 season, the Dodgers and Giants have won the most NL pennants, with 23 each. Representing the National League against the American, the Cardinals have won the most World Series (11) followed by the Giants (8), Dodgers (6), Pirates (5), and Reds (5). St. Louis also holds the distinction of being the only AA club to defeat an NL club in the 19th-century version of the World Series, having done so against their now-division rival Cubs.

===Current teams===

====National League East====
{{main|National League East}}
[[File:Shea Crowded.jpg|thumb|right|Shea Stadium prior to the start of a [[New York Mets]] game in 2008. Shea had the best attendance in the National League that year, drawing over 53,000 fans per game on average.]]
*[[Atlanta Braves]], the oldest continually operating team in Major League Baseball; enfranchised in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (or Red Caps) in National Association, and with connections to the original independent professional [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] of 1869â€“70; joined National League as charter member (1876). Known as "Beaneaters" and other nicknames, as original nickname faded and became re-associated with Cincinnati (and later with the [[Boston Red Sox]]). Adopted nickname "Braves" in 1912. Moved to Milwaukee (1953) and to Atlanta (1966). Prior to the 1994 realignment, the Braves competed in the West division.
*[[Miami Marlins]], enfranchised 1993 as the Florida Marlins, changed name to Miami Marlins (2012).
*[[New York Mets]], enfranchised 1962.
*[[Philadelphia Phillies]], enfranchised 1883 as the Quakers and adopted the Phillies name officially in 1884. From 1943 through 1948, the Phillies unofficially changed their name to the "Philadelphia Blue Jays". Although their jerseys retained the name "Phillies", they wore a blue-jay patch on their sleeve; the Blue Jays moniker was later used for [[Toronto Blue Jays|Toronto]]'s American League team when it began play in 1977. The team is the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in American professional sports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History: Phillies Timeline (1800s) |publisher=Philadelphia Phillies |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline01.jsp |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has been continuously active since 1874, making it the oldest continuously active team in its original city in Major League Baseball. It joined the National League as a charter member (1876). Originally called the "Chicago White Stockings" and later the "Chicago Colts" and several other names, the team was first called "Cubs" in 1902.

The '''American League of Professional Baseball Clubs''', or simply the '''American League''' ('''AL'''), is one of two leagues that make up [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It developed from the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], a minor league based in the [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes states]], which eventually aspired to [[Major League Baseball|major league]] status. It is sometimes called the '''Junior Circuit''' because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the [[National League]] (the "Senior Circuit").

At the end of every season, the American League champion plays in the [[World Series]] against the National League champion; two seasons did not end in playing a World Series (1904, when the National League champion [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] refused to play their AL counterpart, and 1994, when a [[1994 baseball strike|players' strike]] prevented the Series). Through 2018, American League teams have won 66 of the 115 World Series played since 1903, with 27 of those coming from the [[New York Yankees]] alone. The New York Yankees have won 40 American League titles, the most in the league's history, followed by the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] (15) and the [[Boston Red Sox]] (14).

==History==
{{Main|History of the American League}}
[[File:Teams of the American League (2350728586).jpg|right|thumb|upright|American League President and founder [[Ban Johnson]], in center, surrounded by the portraits of the league's eight teams in 1907.]]
Originally a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] known as the [[Western League (1885-1899)|Western League]] which existed 1885 to 1899, with teams in mostly [[Great Lakes]] states, the newly organized Western League later developed into a rival major league after the previous [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882â€“1891) disbanded after ten seasons as a competitor to the older [[National League|National League of Professional Baseball Clubs]] (usually known as the [[National League]]) which was founded in 1876. In its early history of the late 1880s, the minor Western League struggled until 1894, when [[Ban Johnson]] (1864â€“1931) became the president of the league. Johnson led the Western League into elevation as claiming major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League of Professional Baseball Clubs (also simply called the American League) in 1901. The American League was founded in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] at the former Republican Hotel by five Irishmen.  A historical marker is at the intersection of North Old World 3rd Street and West Kilbourn Avenue where the hotel once stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30351|title=Birthplace of the American League Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org|access-date=2019-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Babe Ruth|George Herman ("Babe") Ruth]] (1895â€“1948), noted as one of the most prolific hitters in [[Major League Baseball]] history, spent the majority of his career in the American League with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[New York Yankees]] (plus his first year with his hometown team, the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] of the minor level [[International League]]). The American League has one notable difference versus the rival [[National League]], in that in modern times since 1973 it has had the [[designated hitter]] rule. Under the rule, a team may use a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] in its [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]] who is not in the field defensively, replacing the [[pitcher]] in the batting order, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to bat. In the last two decades, the season schedule has allowed occasional interleague play.

[[File:Walter Johnson and Calvin Coolidge shake hands FINAL.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1872â€“1933, served 1923â€“1929), and [[History of the Washington Senators (1901â€“60)|Washington Senators]] pitcher [[Walter Johnson]] (1887â€“1946, played 1907â€“1927, managed 1929â€“1932 for Senators; managed Cleveland Indians 1933â€“1935), shake hands following the Senators' 1924 American League championship at [[Griffith Stadium]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

Until the late 1970s, league umpires working behind home plate wore large, balloon-style chest protectors worn outside the shirt or coat, while their brethren in the National League wore chest protectors inside the shirt or coat. In 1977, new umpires (including [[Steve Palermo]]) had to wear the inside chest protector, although those on staff wearing the outside protector could continue to do so. Most umpires made the switch to the inside protector, led by [[Don Denkinger]] in 1975 and [[Jim Evans (umpire)|Jim Evans]] the next year, although several did not, including [[Bill Haller]], [[Lou DiMuro]], [[George Maloney]], and [[Jerry Neudecker]], who became the last MLB umpire to use the outside protector in 1985.

In 1994, the league, along with the National League, reorganized again, into three divisions (East, West, and [[American League Central|Central]]) and added a third round to the playoffs in the form of the [[American League Division Series]], with the best second-place team advancing to the playoffs as a wild-card team, in addition to the three divisional champions. In 1998, the newly franchised [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] joined the league, and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] joined the National League: i.e., each league each added a fifteenth team. An odd number of teams per league meant that at least one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day, or alternatively that odd team out would have had to play an [[interleague play|interleague game]] against its counterpart in the other league. The initial plan was to have three five-team divisions per league with inter league play year-roundâ€”possibly as many as 30 interleague games per team each year. For various reasons, it soon seemed more practical to have an even number of teams in both leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed to change leagues, moving from the AL Central to the NL Central. At the same time, the [[Detroit Tigers]] were moved from the AL East to the AL Central, making room for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Devil Rays]] in the East. Following the move of the [[Houston Astros]], which had been in the NL for 51 years since beginning as an expansion team in 1962, to the American League in 2013, both leagues now consist of 15 teams, a far cry from their original 8 for the first half-century of the [[20th century]].

===Permanent Interleague play===
For the first 96 years, American League teams faced their National League counterparts only in exhibition games or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, interleague games have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. As part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the designated-hitter rule is used only in games where the American League team is the home team.

==Teams==

===Charter franchises===
There were eight charter teams in 1901, the league's first year as a major league, and
the next year the original [[History of the St. Louis Browns|Milwaukee Brewers]] moved to St. Louis to become the [[St. Louis Browns]]. These franchises constituted the league for 52 seasons, until the Browns moved to Baltimore and took up the name [[Baltimore Orioles]]. All eight original franchises remain in the American League, although only four remain in the original cities (Detroit, Chicago, Boston, and Cleveland). The eight original teams and their counterparts in the "Classic Eight" were:

*original Baltimore Orioles (went bankrupt and became defunct after 1902 season, not to be confused with the current [[Baltimore Orioles]], see Milwaukee Brewers),&lt;ref name=baltimore&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankrupt Orioles |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2014/07/1901-02-orioles-removed-from-yankees-history/ |website=Baseball-Reference |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723231519/http://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2014/07/1901-02-orioles-removed-from-yankees-history/ |archivedate=July 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced in 1903 by the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]] (became the [[New York Yankees]] in 1913)
*Boston Americans (became the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1908)
*[[Chicago White Sox|Chicago White Stockings]] (became the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1904)
*[[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Blues]]&lt;ref&gt;Officially "Bluebirds", a form seldom used&lt;/ref&gt; (became the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1915)
*[[Detroit Tigers]] (name and locale unchanged from 1894 forward)
*original [[Baltimore Orioles|Milwaukee Brewers]] (became the [[St. Louis Browns]] in 1902 and the new [[Baltimore Orioles]] in 1954)
*[[Philadelphia Athletics]] (became the [[Kansas City Athletics]] in 1955 and the [[Oakland Athletics]] in 1968)
*original [[Washington Senators (1901â€“60)|Washington Senators]] (became the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1961)&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;{{cite web|title=American League|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/sports/baseball/american-league-15007001.topic|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Major League Baseball Authentication Program''', or '''MLB Authentication Program''', is a program run by Major League Baseball Properties, the product licensing arm of [[Major League Baseball]], to guarantee the authenticity of baseball merchandise and memorabilia. The centerpiece of the system is a [[Tamper-evident technology#Seals and signatures|tamper-resistant]] [[security tape]] (sticker) with an [[Security hologram|embedded hologram]].  Each sticker carries a unique alphanumeric code. The sticker is affixed to all game-used merchandise and memorabilia, while information about the item is entered into a computer database. Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season.

== Background ==
Major League Baseball started running an authentication program in 2001 after the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] discovered during an investigation that 75 percent of autographs purported to be from MLB players and other personnel were fake.&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/keeping-it-real-mlb-authenticators-ensure-legitimacy-of-game-used-memorabilia/274421831/ |title=Keeping it real: MLB authenticators ensure legitimacy of game-used memorabilia |work=[[Star Tribune]] |location=[[Minneapolis]], Minnesota |date=September 9, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Megan|last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=digest/&gt; The organization has had a long-running issue with counterfeiting in general, which peaks during the postseason. For example, during the [[2011 National League Championship Series]] between the St Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, MLB officials confiscated over 5,000 counterfeited items, with more than 80 percent being found in the vicinity of [[Busch Stadium]].&lt;ref name=shira&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/10/25/there-disguising-major-league-baseball-efforts-eliminate-counterfeit-merchandise/k0F2FXuf2Ix7vfJAlF9BAL/story.html|title= MLB making genuine effort to fight counterfeiting|first=Shira|last=Springer|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 26, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest haul is during the [[World Series]], when thousands of knock-off jerseys, caps, bags, and other items of merchandise are seized.&lt;ref name=stl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/mlb-scours-ballpark-area-for-fake-merchandise/article_2ae1958d-e7c8-56f8-ab16-626cca191c76.html|title=MLB scours ballpark area for fake merchandise|first=Lisa|last=Brown|date=October 26, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[San Francisco Giants]]â€™ [[2014 World Series]] race, [[United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agents seized over 2,700 pieces of counterfeit MLB merchandise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfappeal.com/2014/10/ice-agents-seize-2700-pieces-of-counterfeit-mlb-merchandise/|title=ICE Agents Seize 2,700 Pieces Of Counterfeit MLB Merchandise|agency=[[Bay City News]]|first=Erin|last=Baldassari|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=The San Francisco Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program description ==
The authentication system centers on a [[hologram]] sticker by OpSec, which carries its own individual alphanumeric code.&lt;ref name=shira/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/authentication/program.jsp|title=MLB Authentication Program Information|website=Major League Baseball|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opsecsecurity.com/brand-protection-enhancement/licensing|title=Licensing|last=|first=|date=2016-01-12|work=OpSec|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sticker is [[Tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]]: the [[Security hologram|embedded hologram]] is ruined if the [[Security tape|sticker]] is removed from the item.&lt;ref name=digest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/featured/an-inside-look-at-the-major-league-baseball-authentication-program|title=An Inside Look at the Major League Baseball Authentication Program|first=Greg|last=Bates|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=[[Sports Collectors Digest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/authentication/hologram_info.jsp|title=MLB Authentication Program: Hologram Information|website=Major League Baseball|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opsecsecurity.com/product-authentication/security-labels|title=Security Labels|last=|first=|date=2016-03-30|work=OpSec|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLB employs approximately 150 authenticators, with four being appointed to each team.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; An MLB authenticator will be present at every MLB game as well as the [[World Baseball Classic]] and team-specific events.&lt;ref name=st /&gt; [[Major League Baseball postseason|MLB postseason]] games will have three or more authenticators.&lt;ref name=si /&gt; The authenticators all have a background in law enforcement and are recommended to the role by their local police departments.&lt;ref name=st /&gt; The authenticator usually sits in the first base camera well.&lt;ref name=si /&gt; Every ball that is taken out of play, without leaving the ballpark, is handed to the authenticator, who enters information about that ball into a computer databaseâ€”such as "the pitcher, batter, inning and the reason the ball came out of play"â€”and then affixes the hologram.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Sanserino |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2014/10/02/authenticators-leave-their-mark-1/stories/201410020346 |title=MLB's Authentication program leaves its mark on memorabilia |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While anything that goes into the stands is generally considered outside their jurisdiction, if there is a batter's milestone occurring, the authenticators will often work with the umpires to mark up baseballs to ensure that even if the milestone ball is hit into the stands, it can be tracked and later authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.esquire.com/sports/a34847/mlb-authenticity-police/ |title=The Secret Agents at Every Major League Baseball Game |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=May 7, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Will|last=Levith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Items authenticated ==
[[File:Juan Lagares Autographed Baseball.jpg|right|thumb|Baseball autographed by [[Juan Lagares]]]]
Usually the MLB Authentication Program authenticates items used during baseball games, with baseballs and [[baseball bat]]s being the most common. Other game-used items which are authenticated include "player jerseys, locker tags, lineup cards, the pitching rubber, home plate, broken bats", and base pads.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt;&lt;ref name=shira/&gt; Any player can request that any item be authenticated, with the request usually being passed to the authenticators by the relevant clubhouse manager.&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2010/12/17/mlb-authentication |title=Behind the scenes with Major League Baseball's authentication process |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Scott|last=Tinley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item with an MLB association can be authenticated. One example of this was when the [[Baltimore Orioles]] got the remains of a dugout telephone that was smashed by the [[Boston Red Sox]]'s [[David Ortiz]] authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/09/22/orioles-david-ortiz-dugout-phone-destroyed-gift/90869974/ |title=Orioles present David Ortiz with dugout phone he destroyed |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Mike|last=Coppinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-charity-items-20141013-story.html |title=Champagne corks, lineup cards, bases â€“ Orioles fans want it all |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=October 13, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Jeff|last=Barker}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then presented the phone to Ortiz during his retirement season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/51030/hold-the-phone-david-ortizs-farewell-gift-from-the-orioles-is-a-smash |title=Hold the phone: David Ortiz's gift from the Orioles is a good call |work=[[ESPN]] |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2018|first=Scott|last=Lauber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/video/ortiz-honored-by-orioles/c-1181500283?tid=8878538 |title=Ortiz honored by Orioles |work=[[MLB.com]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Houston Astros]]' Game 7 win in the [[2017 World Series]] at [[Dodger Stadium]], MLB authenticated jars of dirt taken from the field.&lt;ref name=st /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hlavaty |first=Craig |url=https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/MLB-selling-authenticated-dirt-from-the-Houston-12335471.php |title=MLB selling authenticated dirt from the Houston Astros Game 7 World Series win|work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=November 6, 2017 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt;&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2004/10/28/mlb_wants_to_make_sure_fans_get_the_real_deal?pg=full|title=Major League Baseball wants to make sure fans get the real deal|work=The Boston Globe|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=March 14, 2018|first=Naomi|last=Aoki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game-used memorabilia remains the property of each team, which authenticates items for players who have reached certain milestones, for sale to fans at the team store or on the MLB online store, and for sale to retailers and other marketers of authenticated MLB merchandise.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt;&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Occasionally items are sent for inclusion in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

In 2001 MLB Properties contracted with the [[Arthur Andersen]] accounting firm to oversee and authenticate private autographing sessions for balls, bats, base pads, and other items. The [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]] accounting firm took over this role in 2002.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

'''''Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media''''',  No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a [[New York Supreme Court]] defamation case. Andrew Rector sued [[Major League Baseball]], the [[New York Yankees]], [[ESPN]] and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at [[Yankee Stadium]] between the New York Yankees and the [[Boston Red Sox]] and allegedly making defamatory comments about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/11190576/sleeping-fan-files-10-million-defamation-lawsuit-espn-announcers |title=Sleeping fan files $10 million defamation lawsuit against ESPN, announcers |publisher=ESPN |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector sued for $10 million for "defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress".&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salinger |first=Tobias |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/sleeping-yankees-fan-10m-lawsuit-dismissed-article-1.2379498 |title=Sleeping Yankees fanâ€™s $10M lawsuit dismissed |work=NY Daily News |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
On April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a [[Yankeesâ€“Red Sox rivalry]] game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/80739847-157.html |title=Sleeping Yankees fan sues ESPN, MLB |work=Los Angeles Times |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN New York]] announcers [[Dan Shulman]] and [[John Kruk]] made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium [[jumbotron]]. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of [[MLB.tv]] that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a [[Carlos Beltran]] [[home run]] and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector.&lt;ref name=sl /&gt; They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-baseball-sleeping-fan/dozing-baseball-fans-10-million-espn-lawsuit-is-thrown-out-idUSKCN0RW23820151002 |title=Dozing baseball fan's $10 million ESPN lawsuit is thrown out |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rohan |last=Smith |url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/andrew-rectors-only-crime-was-falling-asleep-at-the-baseball-but-he-was-punished-for-it-mercilessly/news-story/3fa6ed50986be6cb36f259eadf1eba1d |title=Yankee fan falls asleep at baseball and video goes viral - Andrew Rectorâ€™s story |location=Sydney |publisher=News.com.au |date=October 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Gollom |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/why-andrew-rector-the-dozing-baseball-fan-has-no-case-against-espn-1.2700270 |title=Why Andrew Rector, the dozing baseball fan, has 'no case' against ESPN |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan |first=Christopher |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3253876/Judge-dismisses-10million-lawsuit-against-ESPN-announcers-poked-fun-Yankee-fan-fell-asleep-game.html |title=Judge dismisses $10m lawsuit against ESPN announcers that mocked Yankee fan who fell asleep |location=London |publisher=Daily Mail|date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in [[The Bronx, New York]] against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to "an unending verbal crusade".&lt;ref name=sl&gt;{{cite web|last=Beekman |first=Daniel |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/man-slept-yankees-game-sues-10-million-article-1.1857671 |title=Man who slept at Yankees game sues for $10 million |work=NY Daily News |date=July 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under [[New York State]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linshi |first=Jack |url=http://time.com/2967510/sleeping-yankees-fan-lawsuit/ |title=Sleeping Yankees Fan's Lawsuit Won't Get Far, Legal Experts Say |work=Time |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{cite web|first=A.J. |last=Perez |url=http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2014/07/sleeping_yankees_fan_who_filed_defamation_lawsuit_has_a_very_very_difficult_uphill_case.html |title=Here's why sleeping Yankees fan who filed 'idiotic' defamation lawsuit has no shot at winning |publisher=NJ.com |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case ==
Rector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of [[typographical error|typographical]] and [[grammatical error]]s, that the announcers had called him "a fatty cow", then used words such as ''stupor'', ''unintelligent'' and ''stupid'', and said that he was "not worthy to be a fan."&lt;ref name=sl /&gt; He also alleged that [[MLB.com]] had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of "Yankee's {{sic}} Fan cares not for your rivalry talk", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/07/07/report-fan-who-slept-during-red-sox-yankees-game-now-suing-espn-mlb-for-mockery/ |title=Report: Fan Who Slept During Red Sox-Yankees Game Now Suing ESPN, MLB For Mockery |publisher=CBS Boston |date=July 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online "set the stage" for further defamatory comments from online viewers.&lt;ref name=toss /&gt; The MLB's legal team filed a [[motion to dismiss]] on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a [[cause of action]], and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made.&lt;ref name=sg&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/fail/judge-boots-sleepy-fan-lawsuit-674502 |title=Yankee Fan's Defamation Suit Is Put To Sleep |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation.&lt;ref name=toss&gt;{{cite web|last=Italiano |first=Laura |url=https://nypost.com/2015/09/30/judge-tosses-sleeping-yankees-fans-lawsuit-against-espn/ |title=Judge tosses sleeping Yankees fanâ€™s lawsuit against ESPN |work=New York Post |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of "emotional distress", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no [[duty of care]] to protect him from those statements.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; As a result, the case was dismissed.&lt;ref name=toss /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as [[frivolous litigation]].&lt;ref name=aj /&gt;&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Jacobs |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/sleeping-yankees-fan-files-worst-lawsuit-ever |title=Sleeping Yankees Fan Files Worst Lawsuit Ever |work=The Daily Beast |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have.&lt;ref name=iot&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Baghat |date=July 9, 2014 |url=https://www.internetontrial.com/sports-law/sleeping-yankee-fans-lawyer-should-be-disbarred/ |title=Sleeping Yankee fan's lawyer should be disbarred |publisher=Internet on Trial |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector's lawyer, Valentine Okwara had stated that he had advised his client that "there is room for appeal".&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; The lawsuit has since been used as a case study on the issue of defamation at sports events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Litigation Paralegal: A Systems Approach |first=James |last=McCord |year=2016 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=1285857151 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bassin Peel station''' is a planned [[RÃ©seau express mÃ©tropolitain]] station in the borough of [[Le Sud-Ouest]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. It is planned to be operated by [[CDPQ Infra]] and serve as a station on the South Shore branch of the REM.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdpqinfra.com/en/content/r%C3%A9seau-%C3%A9lectrique-m%C3%A9tropolitain-rem-three-new-stations-downtown-montr%C3%A9al&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was planned to be elevated, however, recent reports have suggested that the station will be below grade and passing under the St Lawrence River in an attempt to allow for future development on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/three-rem-train-stations-added-to-proposed-route-through-downtown-montreal&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation was that the Peel Basin will serve as the future site for an [[MLB]] baseball stadium in an attempt to bring the [[Expos]] back to Montreal. On February 12, 2019, the Montreal-based group whose goal is to bring an MLB team back to Montreal, lead by [[Stephen Bronfman]], registered [[Pierre Boivin]], the former president of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], as a lobbyist to negotiate the sale of the Peel Basin to build a [[Peel Basin Stadium|stadium]]. The land is currently under the control of the [[Canada Land Company]], a Federal [[Crown Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2019/02/12/stade-de-baseball--le-bassin-peel-choisi&lt;/ref&gt;

The station will be located near the Peel Basin of the [[Lachine Canal]], and right next to the burgeoning [[Griffintown]] area.
