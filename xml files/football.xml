The '''National Football Conference''' ('''NFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States.  This conference and its counterpart the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), currently contain 16 teams organized into 4 [[Division (sport)|division]]s. Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]] with the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC while the remaining thirteen NFL clubs formed the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 clubs in each conference. The current NFC champions are the [[Los Angeles Rams]], who defeated the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the 2018 [[NFC Championship Game]] for their fourth conference championship.

==Current teams==
Since 2002, like the AFC, the NFC has 16 teams that organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[NFC East|East]], [[NFC North|North]], [[NFC South|South]], and [[NFC West|West]].

This chart of the [[2018 NFL season#Regular season standings|2018 season standings]] displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams in 2018]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[NFC West]]. Thus, [[2019 Los Angeles Rams season|in 2019]], the Rams will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[NFC South]] and [[AFC North]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[NFC East]] and [[NFC North]] (highlighted in orange).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each NFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the NFC West plays against every team in the AFC East and NFC North. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the four division winners and two [[wild card (sports)| wild cards]] (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the NFC qualify for the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]]. The NFC playoffs culminate in the [[NFC Championship Game]] with the winner receiving the [[George Halas| George S. Halas]] Trophy. The NFC Champion then plays the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

==History==
Both the AFC and NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football – History|accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, the NFL consisted of 13 clubs. By 1969, the AFL had expanded to ten teams and the NFL to 16 clubs. In order to balance the merged league, all ten of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Baltimore Colts]] formed the AFC, while the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.

While the newly-formed AFC had already agreed upon and set up their divisional alignment plan along almost purely geographic lines, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to align the clubs in the NFC. The alignment proposals were narrowed down to five finalists (each one sealed in an envelope), and then the plan that was eventually selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]]'s secretary, Thelma Elkjer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-woman-who-aligned-the-nfc-teams.html |title=Sports of The Times; The Woman Who Aligned the N.F.C. Teams |last=Anderson |first=Dave |publisher=New York Times |date=February 27, 2000 |access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 16, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-10-07/sports/9910070115_1_nfc-central-nfc-west-division-afc-central | title=NFL to try realign play | publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] | first=Vito | last=Stellino | date=October 7, 1999 | accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five alignment plans for the NFC in 1970 were as follows, with Plan 3 eventually selected:

*Plan 1
**Eastern – [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[New York Giants]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Washington Redskins]]
**Central – [[Chicago Bears]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Green Bay Packers]]. [[New Orleans Saints]]
**Western – [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Los Angeles Rams]], [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]], [[San Francisco 49ers]]
*Plan 2
**Eastern – Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington
**Central – Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, St. Louis
**Western – Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Los Angeles, San Francisco 
*'''Plan 3'''
**'''Eastern – Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Washington'''
**'''Central – Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota'''
**'''Western – Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco'''
*Plan 4
**Eastern – Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Washington
**Central – Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay
**Western – Dallas, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco 
*Plan 5
**Eastern – Detroit, Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington 
**Central – Chicago, Dallas, Green Bay, St. Louis 
**Western – Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco

Three [[expansion team]]s have joined the NFC since the merger, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in [[1976 NFL season|1976]], they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 realignment]]. The [[Carolina Panthers]] joined the NFC in [[1995 NFL season|1995]].

[[Parity (sports)|Parity]] is generally greater among NFC teams than AFC teams. The only NFC team that has never made a [[Super Bowl]] appearance is the [[Detroit Lions]]. Since the 2002 division realignment, the NFC has sent 12 different teams to the Super Bowl, whereas the AFC has only sent 6: the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (1 time), the [[Oakland Raiders]] (1 time), the [[Denver Broncos]] (2 times), the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (3 times) and the [[New England Patriots]] (9 times). The only NFC team to make back to back Super Bowls since 2002 are the [[Seattle Seahawks]].

As of 2018, the only pre-merger team that does not play in its 1969 market is the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]], who moved in 1988 to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] suburb of [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] (they moved to [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] in 2006). The [[Los Angeles Rams]] [[History of the St. Louis Rams|moved to St. Louis]] in 1995, but moved back to Los Angeles in 2016. None of the expansion teams added after 1970 have relocated.

With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup established in 2002 has remained static ever since.

==Logo==
[[Image:National Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|150px|Original National Football Conference logo (1970–2009)]]
The original NFC logo, in use from 1970 to 2009, depicted a blue 'N' with three stars across it. The three stars represented the three divisions that were used from 1970 to 2001 (Eastern, Central and Western).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logo.php?id=4715|title=National Football Conference Logo|accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 NFL season brought an updated NFC logo. Largely similar to the old logo, the new logo has a fourth star, representing the four divisions that have composed the NFC since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archivedate=May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
[[NFL on CBS|CBS]] aired the NFC's Sunday afternoon and playoffs games from 1970 through the 1993 season. From 1994 to 2013, [[Fox NFL|Fox]] was the primary rightsholder to the NFC's games. Since 2014, the cross-flex policy allows select NFC games to be moved from Fox to CBS. Since 1990, select NFC playoffs games have been seen on ABC or ESPN.

A '''transition tag''' is a tool used by [[National Football League]] teams to retain [[unrestricted free agent]]s.  It guarantees the original club the [[right of first refusal]] to match any offer the player may make with another team.  The transition tag can be used once a year by each club unless they elect to use a [[Franchise Tag|franchise tag]] instead.  Transition tags can be rescinded; however, teams that rescind a transition tag cannot use it again until the next season.

If a player signs a contract after receiving the transition tag, his original team cannot use the tag again on any player until the contract has expired.  The exception is if the player first signs a transition offer sheet, which is a one-year contract equal to the average salary of the top ten players in the league at the player's position, or a twenty percent salary increase, whichever is greater.  This contract was not historically guaranteed; however, it became guaranteed starting in 2007 per the [[collective bargaining agreement]] agreed to by the NFL owners and the [[NFLPA]] on March 8, 2006.  If the player signs the offer sheet prior to a long-term contract, the player's team can then use the tag the next year.

If another club offers a contract to a transitioned player, his original club has seven days to decide whether to match that offer or not.  If the original club agrees to match, the player is forced to sign with the original club at the terms agreed to in the offer by the other club.  If the original club declines to match, the player signs with the other team, and the original team is offered no compensation, as they would be if the player had received the franchise tag.

==History==
The Transition Tag was born in 1993, following the advent of free agency in the NFL.  Teams were afraid of losing their best players to free agency, which was not a concern previously.  The NFL granted each team two transition tags, each of which they could only use once and never again.  The system has been since changed to allow each team to use a transition tag each year it is available to them.

==Disadvantages==
The transition tag is rarely used by NFL franchises.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is that the one-year transition offer is typically a large amount, which could provide the club with difficulties while attempting to keep the team's aggregate salaries under the [[salary cap]].  The other is that players often react badly to receiving the tag, because it limits their ability to negotiate with other teams and therefore hinders their chances of receiving the largest possible contract.  Players sometimes counter the tag by holding out or refusing to play for the club, creating distractions and headaches for the club.

=="Poison pills"==
The advent of the poison pill came in 1996. The 49ers intended to sign Giants running back Rodney Hampton to an offer sheet with a poison pill that stated Hampton would be "on the field for 70% of the offensive plays over the next 2 seasons." The Giants had drafted Tyrone Wheatley with their first round pick in 1995 but he was largely ineffective in his first season. Since he played the same position as Hampton, the Giants had planned to ease him into the offense with Hampton on the back end of his career. For the Giants to match the 6 year deal, they would be forced to play Hampton in 70% of the plays, thus making the previous year's draft pick of Wheatley a loss. The 49ers later decided to not include the clause, as they felt the NFL would never approve the terms. Their assumption would be proven incorrect following the 2005 season, with the historic offer sheet Steve Hutchinson signed with the Minnesota Vikings.

The transition tag's usefulness began to be questioned after the contract offered by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] to [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]], an [[Guard (American football)|offensive guard]] who had received the transition tag following the 2005 season from the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. The contract was for $49 million over seven years, $16 million of which was guaranteed. However, the Vikings added a poison pill: The entire $49 million contract was guaranteed if Hutchinson were not the highest paid offensive linemen on the team he signed with. Since Hutchinson's salary was less than that of the Seahawks' [[Walter Jones (American football)|Walter Jones]], an [[offensive tackle]], his contract would have been guaranteed by the Seahawks, while the Vikings, having no offensive linemen averaging more than Hutchinson's proposed salary, would only be obligated to pay the guaranteed $16 million. The Seahawks filed a grievance with the NFL league office, claiming that the poison pill was illegal under the collective bargaining agreement in that the Seahawks would have to pay significantly more than the Vikings despite matching with exactly the same contract. An [[arbitrator]] ruled in favor of the Vikings, and the Seahawks were essentially unable to match and received no compensation.

In an act of apparent revenge, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] included their own "poison pills" when signing [[restricted free agent]] [[wide receiver]] [[Nate Burleson]]. The total contract was seven years and $49 million—not coincidentally the exact amount of the contract Hutchinson received from the Vikings. The first poison pill stipulated that the entire contract would be guaranteed if Burleson played five or more games in the state of [[Minnesota]] during any year of the contract. This of course would be impossible as a member of the Seahawks, but an inevitability as a member of the Vikings, who played their home games in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minnesota. The second provision would guarantee the full contract if Burleson is paid more on average per year than all of his team's running backs combined. At the time of his signing, the averages of the Vikings' tailbacks fell well shy of the $7 million average of the Burleson offer sheet. However in Seattle, running back [[Shaun Alexander]] alone made an average of over $7 million per year.

In 2011, the NFL and NFLPA ratified a new collective bargaining agreement. In this agreement, poison pill clauses were eliminated from offer sheets issued to players under the transition tag. The specific language in the CBA states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"No Offer Sheet may contain a Principal Term that would create rights or obligations for the Old Club that differ in any way (including but not limited to the amount of compensation that would be paid, the circumstances in which compensation would be guaranteed, or the circumstances in which other contractual rights would or would not vest) from the rights or obligations that such Principal Term would create for the Club extending the Offer Sheet (i.e., no 'poison pills')."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The effect of this additional language has resulted in the transition tag being useful to teams again. In 2014, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] applied the transition tag to [[Jason Worilds]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]] applied the transition tag to [[Alex Mack]]. Worilds signed his transition tag, while Mack accepted an offer sheet from Jacksonville.  Cleveland later matched to the offer sheet, thus keeping Mack as a Brown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">A '''mini-camp''', also spelled '''minicamp''', is a short camp held by [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) teams usually in spring of each year.  The camp usually only lasts 3 days, but the length varies by a day or two depending on the head coach's preference.  Mini-camps are geared toward getting the newly drafted rookies acclimated to the NFL playing schemes.  It also gives coaches and team administrators the chance to see their new players in action learning plays from their new team's playbook.  Several veteran players of each team will also attend mini-camp to refresh their skills and get acquainted with the new players coming in.  Attendance requirements for mini-camp are entirely up to each individual head coach.  Some head coaches push for all of the players to be there, while others ask for just the rookies and younger players to attend.  The drills and plays run at camp are conducted in shorts and T-shirts or jerseys.  They are not "full contact" drills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clayton|first=John|title=Rookie minicamp first impressions|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9267391/nfl-mailbag-rookie-minicamp-first-impressions|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL mini-camps should not be confused with other football camps, for example those for youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarkson|first=Steve|title=Youth Football Camp|url=http://www.steveclarksondreammaker.com/youth-football-camp|publisher=Steve Clarkson’s Quarterback Camp|accessdate=22 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030081250/http://www.steveclarksondreammaker.com/youth-football-camp|archivedate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the CFL, these camps are also referred to as '''rookie''' or '''free-agent camps'''. The Canadian league began holding them in  2010, when a new collective-bargaining agreement with its player association permitted teams to hold voluntary, non-contact, off-season workouts for up to three days, starting February 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/sports/football/cfl-mini-camp-season-in-full-swing|title=CFL mini-camp season in full swing|last=Mitchell|first=Scott|date=2016-04-15|work=Calgary Herald|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, CFL mini-camps were held from mid-April through mid-May in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Checking Down: Mini-camp season arrives - CFL.ca|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2017/04/11/checking-mini-camp-season-arrives/|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=CFL.ca|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48033">{{short description|Sports season}}
The [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[season (sport)|regular season]] begins on the weekend following the first Monday of September (i.e, the weekend following the [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] holiday) and ends in December or early January. It consists of 256 games, where each team (32 total) plays 16 games during a 17-week period. Since 2012, the NFL schedule generally has games in one of five time slots during the week. The first game of the week is [[Thursday Night Football|played on Thursday night]], kicking off at 8:20 PM ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]). The majority of games are played on Sunday, most kicking off at 1:00 PM (ET), some late afternoon games starting at 4:05 or 4:25 PM (ET). Additionally, [[NBC Sunday Night Football|one Sunday night game]] is played every week at 8:20 PM (ET). One [[Monday Night Football|Monday night game]] then starts at 8:15 PM (ET) every week with the exception of the first week of the regular season, in which two Monday night games are played back-to-back (the second game always occurring on the West coast), as well as the last week of the season, in which no Monday night game is held. In addition to these regularly scheduled games, there are occasionally games at other times, such as a Saturday afternoon or evening, or the annual [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] in which three games are played. Under a permanent agreement, the Detroit Lions play the early game, followed by Dallas in the afternoon. The evening game does not have a set team. During the final week of the regular season, all games are held on Sunday, and since 2010, divisional matchups.

In place since 2006, the current broadcasting contract establishes broadcast partners for each game.  The Sunday afternoon games are broadcast either on [[CBS]] or [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].  CBS has the broadcast rights for teams in the [[American Football Conference]] while Fox has the rights for teams in the [[National Football Conference]].  In games where teams from both conferences play each other, the network with the broadcast rights for the "away" team will broadcast the game.  In each [[Media market|local television market]], three Sunday afternoon games are shown.  One of the two networks gets a [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]], while the other network has the right to broadcast a single game; the networks alternate weeks when each has the right to the doubleheader.  Doubleheader games are broadcast at 1:00 (ET) and 4:25 PM (ET).  The network with the single game will have an official kick-off time at either 1:00 PM (ET) or 4:05 PM (ET).  In addition to the regular Sunday afternoon games, there are three [[prime time]] games each week.  The Thursday night game is broadcast by the [[NFL Network]] (with, since 2018, ten of those Thursday games also being simulcast by [[Fox NFL|Fox]]).&lt;ref name="deadline-tnf2016nbccbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS &amp; NBC To Share ‘Thursday Night Football' With NFL Network; League Eyes "Tri-Cast" With Digital Partner|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/thursday-night-football-cbs-nbc-share-nfl-network-1201694273/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday night game is broadcast by [[NBC]], while the Monday night game is broadcast by [[ESPN]].

The NFL uses a strict scheduling [[algorithm]] to determine which teams play each other from year to year, based on the current division alignments and the final division standings from the previous season.  The current formula has been in place since {{NFL year|2002}}, the last year that the NFL expanded its membership.  Generally, each team plays the other three teams in its own [[National Football League#Clubs|division]] twice, all four teams from a single division in the AFC once, all four teams from a single division in the NFC once, and two additional intraconference games based on the standings from the previous season.

==Game times==
{{Main article|NFL on television}}
Since 1990, the majority of NFL regular-season games are played on Sundays at 1 pm, or around 4:00 to 4:25pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] (see below), with the late afternoon (ET) games usually reserved either for matches hosted in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] or [[Mountain Time Zone]], or for one or more marquee contests.  The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS, with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC. Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country.

Every Sunday of the regular season, either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package, while the other network may show only one game. Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4:00pm EST, while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4:25pm; this is to avoid conflicts with 1:00pm games that have run late.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a31224/article/nfl-pushes-late-doubleheader-games-back-to-425-pm-et NFL pushes late doubleheader games back to 4:25 p.m. ET]&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots, in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country:
# One [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night]] game, which has been regularly scheduled since 1987, and has aired on NBC since 2006.
# One [[Monday Night Football]] game, which has been regularly scheduled since 1970, and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006. Also since 2006, two games have been on the first Monday of the season. The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to, among other reasons, low ratings, and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason.
# On Thursday nights since 2006, one game has been played and aired on the [[NFL Network]] on the weeks including and after [[Thanksgiving Day]].  In addition, during the day on Thanksgiving, the NFL has played [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] since 1920; by tradition the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[Detroit Lions]] always host these afternoon games, and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving. Since 2012, the NFL has games on Thursday nights every season.
# Should there be a need for it, an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game, only in mid to late December, due to the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]]. December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970, except for 2013.

Since the 2006 season, the NFL has used a "[[NFL on television#Flexible scheduling|flexible scheduling]]" system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game. In 2014, that was expanded to include weeks 5 – 17.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/flexible-schedules&lt;/ref&gt; Flex scheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for surprise teams to play in primetime.

In its early years after {{nfly|1920}}, the NFL did not have a set schedule, and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games, many against independent professional, college, or amateur teams. From {{nfly|1926}} through {{nfly|1946}}, they played from eleven to fourteen games per season, depending on the number of teams in the league. From {{nfly|1947}} through {{nfly|1960}}, each NFL team played 12 games per season. The [[American Football League]] began play in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]] and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen-week season, in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice, with one bye week. Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen-game schedule in {{nfly|1961}}.

Also in 1961, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961|Sports Broadcasting Act]] in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated [[antitrust law]]s. The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks, but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games. Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December.&lt;ref name="Sports Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsAcademicPrograms/sportslaw_index.aspx?id=16201|title=Sports Law|last=Sensei|first=Andrew|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From {{nfly|1961}} through {{nfly|1977}}, the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks, except in {{nfly|1966}}. Opening weekend typically was the weekend after [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]], or rarely two weekends after Labor Day. Teams played six or seven exhibition games. In 1966 (and 1960), the NFL had an odd number of franchises,  so one team was idle each week. In {{nfly|1978}}, the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games. From 1978 through {{nfly|1989}}, the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks.

In {{nfly|1990}}, the NFL re-introduced a [[Bye (sports)|bye week]] to the schedule, which it had not had since 1966. Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks. During the season, on a rotating basis, each team would have the weekend off. As a result, opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend. The league had an odd number of teams (31) from {{nfly|1999}} to {{nfly|2001}}. During that period, at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week. For the {{nfly|1993}} season, the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team, resulting in an 18-week regular season. In 2001, the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games, leading to another 18-week season.

Since the {{nfly|2002}} season, the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season [[NFL Kickoff game|kickoff game]] on the Thursday night after Labor Day, prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season. The first one, featuring the [[2002 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[2002 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], was held on September 5, 2002 largely to celebrate New York City's resilience in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20020905_SF@NYG |title=Niners edge Giants on late field goal 16-13 |last=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=NFL.com |date=2002-09-05 |accessdate=2006-11-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913021431/http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20020905_SF@NYG |archivedate=2006-09-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. Under this scheduling system, the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4, as it was in the {{nfly|2008}} and {{nfly|2014}} seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Monday, while the latest possible is September 10, as it was in the {{nfly|2009}} and {{nfly|2015}} seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday.

* Each team plays twice against each of the other three teams in its division: once at home, and once on the road (six games).
* Each team plays once against each of the four teams from another division within its own conference, with the assigned division based on a three-year rotation: two at home, and two on the road (four games).
* Each team plays once against one team from each of the remaining two divisions within its conference, based on the final division standings from the prior season: one at home, one on the road (two games).
* Each team plays once against each of the four teams from a division in the other conference, with the assigned division based on a four-year rotation: two at home, and two on the road (four games).

Under this formula, all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their own conference at least once every three years, and to play every team in the other conference exactly once every four years. The formula also guarantees a similar schedule for every team in a division each season, as all four teams will play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents or each other.

Non-divisional intraconference match-ups can occur over consecutive years if two teams happen to finish in the same place consistently. For example, even though the [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] and [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] are in different divisions within the same conference, the two teams played each other every season between 2003 and 2012, largely because both teams often finished in first place in their divisions each previous season. Similarly, the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] and the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] played each other each season from 2008 to 2012 because both teams often landed in fourth place in their divisions.

Outside intradivisional match-ups (each of which is played twice-yearly), the home team for each match-up is also determined by the league according to a set rotation designed to largely alternate home and away designations over successive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scales|first1=Kristi|title=SCHEDULE RELEASE: SO HOW DOES THE NFL DETERMINE THE COWBOYS' SCHEDULE?|url=http://www.5pointsblue.com/schedule-release-so-how-does-the-nfl-determine-the-cowboys-schedule/|website=5 Points Blue|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rotation was slightly adjusted in 2010 for teams playing against the [[NFC West]] and [[AFC West]], after several east-coast teams (such as the [[2008 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] and [[2008 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in {{nfly|2008}}) all had to make four cross-country trips to play games in [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], and [[Seattle]] in one season.&lt;ref name="ESPNWestCoast"&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4009230 NFL to make West Coast road format more reasonable&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this scheduling formula determines each of the thirty-two teams' respective opponents, the league usually does not release the final regular schedule with specific dates and times until the spring; the NFL needs several months to coordinate the entire season schedule to align with various secondary objectives — such as accommodating various scheduling conflicts, not forcing teams to play too many consecutive games at home or on the road, avoiding giving any one team significantly more rest time than their opponent, and maximizing potential TV ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/65537 | title=NFL schedule navigated World Series, other conflicts | publisher=[[Sports Business Journal]] | date=April 26, 2010 | accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/sports/nfl-schedule-makers-try-their-best-to-please-everybody.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title=The Art and Science of Scheduling Meet in the N.F.L.

===Past formulas===
Prior to {{nfly|2002}} (when the league expanded to 32 teams) the league used similar scheduling rubrics, though they were adjusted for the number of teams and divisions. From 1970 to 1994, and again from 1999 to 2001, the league did not have equal numbers of teams in every division, so not every team's opposition could be determined by the same means. While teams playing against their division rivals twice each has been a tradition since at least the [[AFL–NFL merger]], not all teams would play the same amount of divisional games between the divisions due to the imbalances that had existed. The AFC Central in between 1999 and 2001, consisting of six teams resulting in part from the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]], forced teams to play ten intradivision games in a 16-game schedule. The only time since the merger that the league has been completely "balanced" has been from 1995 to 1998 (with six divisions of five teams each) and since 2002 (with eight divisions of four teams each). From 1978 up to 2002, most teams always played four of the teams from a division in the other conference on a rotating basis (with certain exceptions differing between time periods), while lacking a rotary schedule within its own conference; this meant that while a team would be more likely to play every team in the other conference on a regular basis, they could go far longer without playing every team in their own. For example, between 1970 (when the leagues merged) and 2002 (when the current schedule was introduced) the Denver Broncos and the Miami Dolphins played only 6 times, including a stretch where they met only once between 1976 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teamvsteam.html?tm=10&amp;opp=17|title=Denver Broncos Vs.

This is an example of the formula used for determining opponents for teams that finished in last place in each of the five-team divisions between 1978 and 1994, when the league consisted of 28 teams playing 16 games each. The [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990 New England Patriots]] finished in last place in the [[AFC East]]. Therefore, [[1991 New England Patriots season|in]] {{nfly|1991}}, they played all of their division rivals (marked in red) twice each, one game against each team in the four-team [[AFC Central]] (marked in yellow), two games against the last-place finisher in the [[AFC West]] (marked in orange), and one game each against the last-place finishers in the [[NFC East]] and [[NFC Central]] (marked in blue).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;
This is an example of the formula used for determining a team's opponents between 1995 and 1998, when the league consisted of six divisions of five teams each. The [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|1996 San Francisco 49ers]] finished in 2nd place in the [[NFC West]]. Therefore, [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|in]] {{nfly|1997}}, the 49ers played all their division rivals (marked in red) twice each, one game each against the other second-place finishers in the NFC (marked in orange), one game against one additional team in the [[NFC East]] and [[NFC Central]], and one game against each team in the [[AFC West]] (marked in yellow) ''except'' for the 4th-place [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

====1995–1998 NFL scheduling formula====
When the divisions were balanced between 1995 and 1998, each team would play a home and away series against their divisional rivals (8 games), two teams from each of the other divisions within the conference (two having finished the same place, and two others determined by where they placed in the standings), and four teams from a division in the other conference by the aforementioned rotary basis (where the team placed in the standings determines which team in the interconference division they will not play, and that team would have the "polar opposite" place (i.e.: 1st is the polar opposite of 5th) in their division).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} An example of which can be seen to the right.

====1978–1994 NFL scheduling formula====
The scheduling formula before 1995 was very similar, except in a modified format to fit not having fully balanced divisions. During these years, teams in five-team divisions who did not finish last would not normally face a 5th place team outside their division, whether or not those teams were intraconference. There was a special so-called "last place" or "fifth-place" schedule for teams who finished in last place in a five-team division. In addition to their division games, a team who finished in last place in the previous season would also primarily play the other teams who finished in last place in their respective divisions (the intraconference one would be played twice to fill a void otherwise taken by a ''third'' team that finished the same place), plus all the clubs in the four team division in their conference. An example of this is also shown to the right. The teams in a four-team division played only six divisional games, as opposed to the eight that teams in five-team divisions had played. This void would be filled by having to play against the 5th place teams in their conference in addition to their regular scheduling, hence tying to the "fifth-place" schedule.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

====Regular season expansion proposals====
There have been proposals to expand the regular season schedule to 17 or 18 games per team. Current Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] has said he favors expanding it to 18 games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-goodell-economy&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Yahoo! Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a longer regular season proposal was defeated in the 2011 labor negotiations between the owners and the players association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/sports/football/24nfl.html N.F.L.

USA Today (2010-10-19). Retrieved 2010-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL Players' Association opposes extending the season, largely because of injury concerns, and extending the season would require that such an extension be included in the next [[collective bargaining agreement]]. The collective bargaining agreement signed in 2011 maintained the sixteen game regular season schedule.

==Scheduled division matchups==
This chart displays the current schedule of division match-ups, based on the three-year intra-conference and four-year inter-conference rotations in place since 2002.

==Regular season games played outside the U.S.==
{{main article|NFL International Series}}

To date, several NFL regular season games have been played outside the U.S.  The first was the 2005 game between the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], which was played in [[Mexico City]].

In October 2006, NFL club owners approved a plan to stage up to two international regular season games per season beginning in 2007 and continuing through at least 2011.&lt;ref name="internationalPlan"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9752443 | title=Resolution approved for international games | publisher=NFL.com | date=2006-10-24 | accessdate=2007-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106140758/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9752443 | archivedate=2007-01-06 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Giants]] and the  [[Miami Dolphins]]  played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London on October 28, 2007 for the first of these games.&lt;ref name="LondontoHost"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9971024 | title=London to host 2007 regular-season game | publisher=NFL.com | date=2007-01-16 | accessdate=2007-02-10 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064219/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9971024 | archivedate=2007-02-04 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A second game in London took place on Sunday 26 October 2008, when the [[San Diego Chargers]] took on the nominal 'home team' [[New Orleans Saints]], also at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/american_football/7688785.stm Game report on BBC website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New England Patriots]] were the designated visitors when they beat the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 35-7 on October 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80cf6117&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2009/10/26/patriots_game_is_too_strong_for_buccaneers | work=The Boston Globe | title=Towers of London | first=Christopher L. | last=Gasper | date=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long term plan was originally to have two international games played every year, on a 16-year rotating schedule that would guarantee that each team would get to play twice over that span: once as the home team and once as the away team. This was abandoned when the [[St. Louis Rams]], who are co-owned with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], a prominent soccer team in London, signed a three-year agreement to be the home team in the International Series games in London.  This plan has since been re-established after the Rams announced that they would not be returning to England in 2013; the Rams would return to London as host team in 2016.

Since, the NFL has announced that the Jacksonville Jaguars will play one home game a season at Wembley, up to and including 2016, later extended to 2020.  Their first game, versus the San Francisco 49ers, saw the 49ers winning comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000270612/article/colin-kaepernick-leads-san-francisco-49ers-over-jacksonville-jaguars&lt;/ref&gt;  A second game was played at Wembley for the first time, with the Minnesota Vikings hosting and beating the Pittsburgh Steelers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013092906/2013/REG4/steelers@vikings#menu=highlights&amp;tab=recap&amp;recap=fullstory&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a record three fixtures were announced from the 2014 season, with the Jacksonville Jaguars hosting the Dallas Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons hosting the Detroit Lions and the Oakland Raiders hosting the Miami Dolphins at Wembley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000268789/article/six-nfl-teams-set-for-2014-international-series-games-in-london&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Buffalo Bills]] played one regular season game each year from 2008 through 2013 in [[Toronto]] as part of the [[Bills Toronto Series]]; two preseason games were also played as part of the same series. Poor ticket sales, fan disgust in Buffalo and the death of Bills owner [[Ralph Wilson]] prompted the cancellation of the series in 2014.

== Disruptions of the schedule ==
{{see also|Canceled NFL games|Chronology of home stadiums for current National Football League teams#Temporary home stadiums|label 2=Temporary NFL home stadiums}}

===Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations===
From the beginnings of the NFL, some teams shared stadiums with [[Major League Baseball]] teams, with the MLB teams holding leases giving them priority. The NFL was required to schedule around September baseball games. In October, this frequently resulted in NFL teams having to reschedule on short notice if the MLB team in their city made the playoffs. On some occasions, the NFL game could be moved to Saturday or Monday. The NFL would often schedule October division games so that teams would be able to swap home game dates if it appeared that the MLB playoff schedule would make a stadium unavailable to the NFL. Perhaps the most extreme case was in 1973, when the [[New York Jets]] played at [[Shea Stadium]] and were forced to play their first six games on the road due to the [[New York Mets|Mets]] playing in the [[World Series]].

As more MLB teams started to move into baseball-only stadiums by the 1990s and 2000s, this became less of a problem. Currently, the only remaining shared NFL-MLB venue is the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]], which houses the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Oakland Athletics]]. Additionally, four NFL teams currently share a venue with a [[Major League Soccer]] team: the [[New England Patriots]] share [[Gillette Stadium]] with the [[New England Revolution]], the [[Seattle Seahawks]] share [[CenturyLink Field]] with the [[Seattle Sounders FC]], the [[Atlanta Falcons]] share [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] with [[Atlanta United FC]], and the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] share the [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] with the [[LA Galaxy]]. However, there are some NFL and MLB venues that share parking lots, and as such the NFL typically schedules teams to play on the road when their MLB counterpart is at home. The following teams play in close proximity to MLB stadiums:
* [[Baltimore Ravens]]
* [[Cincinnati Bengals]]
* [[Dallas Cowboys]]
* [[Detroit Lions]]
* [[Kansas City Chiefs]]
* [[Philadelphia Eagles]]
* [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]
* [[Seattle Seahawks]]

While both the NFL and MLB teams play in downtown stadiums in [[Cleveland]], [[Denver]] and [[Minneapolis]], the teams do not share the same parking lots as they play in different parts of the downtown area. As such, it is possible for the Browns, Broncos and Vikings to play home games on the same day the Indians, Rockies and Twins, respectively, play at home.

In {{nfly|2013}}, the [[Super Bowl XLVII]] champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] were forced to open on the road due to this fact, as their MLB counterparts, the [[Baltimore Orioles]], were scheduled at home on the same day as the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Week 1 NFL Kickoff game]] and declined to either reschedule or relocate their game. (MLB typically releases the schedule for an upcoming season prior to the end of the previous season, forcing the NFL to accommodate the scheduling needs of teams who share parking lots or stadiums with MLB teams, while MLS typically releases their season schedule well ahead of the NFL's schedule release.) The [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] champion Seattle Seahawks averted this conflict for the {{nfly|2014}} season opener, as their MLB counterparts, the [[Seattle Mariners]], played on the road; their respective venues also share the same parking lot. The Seattle Sounders FC also played on the road during the opening week of the 2014 NFL season, assuring no scheduling conflicts. The [[Buffalo Bills]] also hosted one game a year at the [[Rogers Centre]], which is the home of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], but this was only an issue in the preseason, since all such regular season games were scheduled after the end of the MLB [[World Series]].

NFL teams have also shared stadiums with NCAA college football teams and [[bowl game]]s, either temporarily or permanently, but the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]] prohibits the NFL from scheduling games on the same days as college football games.&lt;ref name="Sports Law"/&gt;

===Labor disputes===
The [[1982 NFL Season|1982]] and [[1987 NFL Season|1987]] seasons were both shortened by [[National Football League Players Association|labor disputes]]. The [[National Football League Players Association#1982 strike|1982 strike]] lasted 57 days. Weeks 3 through 10 were canceled, but an additional week was added to make a 9-game schedule. The 1982 playoff matchups were determined by conference standings only.  The [[National Football League Players Association#1987 strike and decertification|1987 strike]] and subsequent [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] lasted 24 days but only one week of the schedule was lost.  Weeks 4 through 6 were played with [[strikebreakers|non-union replacement players]].  The rest of the [[1987 NFL Season|season]] was played as originally scheduled, for a total of 15 games per team.

In the event that the [[2011 NFL season]] had been disrupted because of a then-ongoing labor dispute, the NFL had arranged its schedule to facilitate easier cancellations and postponements. In addition to an emergency scenario of an eight-game schedule beginning in late November, the NFL also arranged its full-length schedule such that weeks 2 and 4 had no division games, week 17 had all division games, and all week 3 matchups could be moved into each team's respective bye week. The league also had a contingency plan to postpone [[Super Bowl XLVI]] one week, which (assuming a full playoff schedule) would allow a 13-game schedule with five division games for each team to be played beginning as late as October 16.

===Natural disasters===
Several games have been postponed or relocated because of natural disasters. In 1989, [[Candlestick Park]] was damaged by the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] would play their game on October 22, 1989 against the [[New England Patriots]] at [[Stanford Stadium]] in [[Palo Alto]]. A few days before the start of the [[2005 NFL Season]], the [[Louisiana Superdome]] was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]], and much of the city of [[New Orleans]] was destroyed.  The [[New Orleans Saints]]' eight scheduled home games were moved to other locations, including [[Giants Stadium]], the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], and Tiger Stadium on the campus of [[Louisiana State University]]. On September 14, 2008, the [[Houston Texans]] were scheduled to host the [[Baltimore Ravens]].  The game was postponed until November 9 because of [[Hurricane Ike]] (which caused some damage to [[Reliant Stadium]]) and several other changes had to be made to the schedule. The roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] collapsed on December 12, 2010 after a severe heavy snowstorm, resulting in the stadium being unusable for the remainder of the season. The last two of the [[Minnesota Vikings]]' home games had to be moved: one to [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]] (which also led to the game being postponed the following Monday night) and another to [[TCF Bank Stadium]], the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|University of Minnesota]]'s [[college football]] stadium.

The [[Miami Dolphins]] have been involved in a number of games that were moved to a different time and date. A few of those games would include 1992 against the [[New England Patriots]] ([[Hurricane Andrew]]), 2004 against the [[Tennessee Titans]] ([[Hurricane Ivan]]) and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ([[Hurricane Jeanne]]), 2005 against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] ([[Hurricane Wilma]]), 2017 against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] ([[Hurricane Irma]]), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-15/sports/9201270532_1_dick-macpherson-super-bowl-individual-game | newspaper=[[Sun Sentinel]] | title=Pats Coach Says Hurricane Andrew Has Hurt His Team | date=October 15, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2004-09-25-jeanne-ppd_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Hurricane Jeanne moves back Steelers-Dolphins | date=September 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2198438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=To avoid Wilma, NFL moves Chiefs-Dolphins game to Friday | date=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, a Minnesota Vikings–[[Philadelphia Eagles]] game originally scheduled for the afternoon of Sunday, December 26, a time at which it could have been successfully completed, had two weeks earlier been flexed by [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] to Sunday night and was postponed to Tuesday, December 28, due to a strong [[Nor'easter]].
In 2014, the Week 12 visit of the Jets to Buffalo was moved to Detroit (and from Sunday to Monday) due to [[November 13–21, 2014 North American winter storm|severe snow]] in Western New York the previous week.

===Other major news events===
The [[American Football League]], the precursor to today's [[American Football Conference]], postponed Week 12 of the [[1963 AFL season|1963 season]] because of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President Kennedy]], on Friday, November 22.  The AFL's games were made up by adding a 15th week to a 14-week schedule. The older and more established [[National Football League]] went ahead and played as scheduled on Sunday, November 24, 1963.

In {{NFL year|2001}}, Week 2 of the season was postponed because of the [[September 11 attacks]].  At the end of the originally planned 17-week schedule, Week 2 games were played on Sunday, January 6 and Monday, January 7, 2002. The  [[2001–02 NFL playoffs|post-season schedule]] was moved back a week, including [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] due to the lack of a bye week before the game; since 2003, the season ends on the first Sunday in February.

The '''National Football League (NFL) Foundation''', previously known as NFL Charities, is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit making]] [[charitable organization]], established by the member clubs of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in 1973. It enables the clubs to collectively make grants to charitable and worthwhile causes at a national level.

== Youth initiatives ==
The NFL Foundation works with [[USA Football]] to teach children the fundamentals of playing football safely. To help do so, the Foundation gives grants to youth and high school football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = NFL Foundation commits $45 million to USA Football programs |url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000336295/article/nfl-foundation-commits-45-million-to-usa-football-programs |accessdate = January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Working with USA Football, the NFL Foundation also developed [[flag football|NFL FLag]], a non-tackle version of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Titans, USA Football Award Grants to Local Youth Football Programs |url = https://www.titansonline.com/news/titans-usa-football-award-nfl-foundation-funded-grants-to-local-youth-school-bas |accessdate = January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = NFL Foundation Awards $45 Million for Youth Football |url = https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/nfl-foundation-awards-45-million-for-youth-football |accessdate = January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL Foundation is also responsible for creating a program called FUNdamentals which introduces the game of football to kids who have never played the sport before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nflfoundation.org/youth-football|title=Youth Football - NFL Foundation|website=www.nflfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heads Up Football ===
USA Football created Heads Up Football, in part funded by the NFL Foundation, to focus on improving several areas of football that relates to the safety of the players. This program teaches coaches better safety procedures and proper tackling drills. The NFL Foundation, as well as USA Football, have claimed that the program has helped reduce injuries by 76 percent and concussions by about 30 percent. However, research cited by the Foundation shows that Heads Up Football has shown no reduction of concussions and a significantly lower effect on injuries than claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = N.F.L.-Backed Youth Program Says It Reduced Concussions. The Data Disagrees. |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/sports/football/nfl-concussions-youth-program-heads-up-football.html |accessdate = January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grants and charitable work ==

Grants amounting to $10 million each year are donated to organizations such as the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America]] and the [[American Heart Association]]. One of the youngest athletes to donate to the Boys and Girl Club is [[Jacques Williams|Jacquese Williams]].&lt;ref name="Join"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jointheteam.com/programs/program.asp?p=42&amp;c=6|publisher= NFL Join The Team |title= Message from the Commissioner|accessdate= 2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL foundation supports several charitable initiatives:

*Play 60 – An initiative aimed at getting kids out and playing for 60 minutes to help fight obesity.

*A Crucial Catch – The NFL foundation partnered with the American Cancer society in an effort to raise awareness. Every October the NFL also participates in raising awareness for breast cancer by wearing pink on their uniforms.

*Salute to service – The NFL Foundation provides grants to supports those who have served or are currently serving in our military.

*Player Foundation Grants – The NFL Foundation provides grants that give assistance to those currently in the NFL and to those who have previously played in the NFL.

*[[Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award]] – This award recognized a players contributions on and off the field.

*Super Bowl Legacy Grants – The NFL Foundation gives the city that hosted the Super Bowl one million dollars as a grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nflfoundation.org/community|title=Community - NFL Foundation|website=www.nflfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
[[Image:NFL Charities.jpg|thumb|The previous logo when the charity was known as NFL Charities]]
The current chair of NFL Foundation, [[Charlotte Jones Anderson]], was appointed chairman by the NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/community/nflfoundation|title=NFL FOUNDATION|date=2014-06-24|work=Dallas Cowboys|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte Jones Anderson is also the Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer of [[Dallas Cowboys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''Physically unable to perform''' ('''PUP''') is a roster designation used in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for players who suffered injuries during football-related activities prior to the start of training camp. Players on the PUP list may participate in team meetings, and take advantage of the training and medical facilities, but cannot practice with the team.  There are two separate PUP lists: an active PUP list used during prior to the start of the regular season, and a reserve PUP list used during the regular season.

==Active/PUP==
A player who, as a result of football-related injuries, is unable to take part in [[training camp]] practices may be assigned to the active/PUP list at the start of camp. Players can be moved off the PUP list to the active roster at any time prior to the start of the regular season, even after one practice. A player cannot be placed on the PUP list, however, once he has taken the field for a practice or game.

==Reserve/PUP==
A player who finishes the preseason still on the PUP list can then be moved to the reserve/PUP list. Such players must sit out the first six weeks of the regular season. At that point, teams have a five-week window in which to allow the player to begin practicing; from the day the player begins practicing, teams have an additional 21-day window in which to decide whether to activate the player to the 53-man roster. If either of those deadlines pass, the player must remain on the PUP list for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL Makes Minor Change to Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) List Rules |url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2013/07/27/nfl-makes-minor-change-to-physically-unable-to-perform-pup-list-rules/ |work=sportsmedia101.com/ |date=July 27, 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Football League Players Association''', or '''NFLPA''', is the [[Trade union|labor organization]] representing the [[American football|professional American football]] players in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The NFLPA, which has headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], is led by president [[Eric Winston]] and executive director [[DeMaurice Smith]]. Founded in 1956, the NFLPA is the second-oldest labor union of the four major professional sports leagues; it was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a [[National Football League collective bargaining agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA). The NFLPA is a member of the [[AFL–CIO]], the largest federation of unions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://aflcio.org/about/our-unions-and-allies/affiliates | title=Our Affiliated Unions | publisher = AFL-CIO | accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the NFL, contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of [[Strike action|strikes]] and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.

In addition to conducting labor negotiations, the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players; the organization's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe. The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams. It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession.

==Background==

The establishment of the [[National Football League]] in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Town That Hated Pro Football|url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rochster|work=The Coffin Corner|author=Carroll, Bob|year=1981|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319230728/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rochster|archivedate=March 19, 2006|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits.&lt;ref name="Part1"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the NFLPA, Part 1 |url=https://nflpa.com/about/history |publisher=National Football League Players Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204220612/http://www.nflplayers.com/articles/cba-news/history-of-the-nflpa-part-1/ |archivedate=December 4, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Roy Zimmerman (American football)|Roy Zimmerman]]'s refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the [[Washington Redskins]] to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].{{sfn|Algeo|pp=85, 105–106}} With the formation of the competing [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.&lt;ref name="Radovich"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports of The Times; N.F.L.'s Labor Pioneer Remains Unknown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/sports/sports-of-the-times-nfl-s-labor-pioneer-remains-unknown.html?src=pm|work=The New York Times|author=Rhoden, William C.|date=October 2, 1994|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Radovich]], an offensive lineman, was one player who "jumped" leagues; he played for the [[Detroit Lions]] in 1945 and then joined the [[Los Angeles Dons]] of the AAFC after the team offered him a greater salary.&lt;ref name="Radovich"/&gt; Subsequently, Radovich was [[blacklisted]] by the NFL and was denied a tryout with the NFL-affiliated [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] baseball team of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. Unable to attain a job in either league, Radovich filed a lawsuit against the NFL in 1956.&lt;ref name="Radovich"/&gt; The case, ''[[Radovich v. National Football League]],''{{ussc|352|445|1957}} made its way to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in January 1957, with the court ruling that the NFL constituted a business under American antitrust law and did not enjoy the same immunity accorded to [[Major League Baseball]].&lt;ref name=NVB&gt;Norman Van Brocklin, "Why a Players' Association is Necessary in Professional Football," ''Pro Football 1957.'' Los Angeles: Petersen Publishing Co., 1957; pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling "set the foundation for a series of court battles" over compensation and employment conditions.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |work=USA Today |author=Bell, Jarrett |date=March 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206043017/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial organizing phase (1956-1967)==

The NFLPA began when two players from the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Abe Gibron]] and [[Dante Lavelli]], approached a lawyer and former [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] football player, [[Creighton Miller]], to help form an association to advocate for the players.{{sfn|Coenen|p=181}} Miller was initially reluctant but accepted in 1956. He contacted [[Don Shula]] (a [[Baltimore Colts (1953-1983)|Baltimore Colts]] player at the time), [[Joe Schmidt (American football)|Joe Schmidt]] of the Detroit Lions, [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Sam Huff]] of the [[New York Giants]], and [[Norm Van Brocklin]] of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to aid in the development of the association.&lt;ref name="Part1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordy"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Gordy, 73, dies; former Detroit Lions lineman led NFL players' union |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-gordy1-2009feb01,0,917663.story |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Noland, Claire |date=February 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629001803/http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-gordy1-2009feb01,0,917663.story |archivedate=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1956 a majority of the players signed cards allowing the NFLPA to represent them.&lt;ref name="Part1"/&gt; Players for 11 of the 12 teams in the league voted to join the new association, with the [[Chicago Bears]] being the sole holdout.&lt;ref name=NVB /&gt;

An initial meeting was convened at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in November 1956 where players decided on demands to be submitted to league commissioner [[Bert Bell]].&lt;ref name="Part1"/&gt; One particularly sore point involved the lack of compensation for [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] and preseason [[exhibition games]]; while owners charged admission and benefitted from a lucrative series of preseason games, no contract payment was made until a player made a regular season roster.{{sfn|Ratterman with Deindorfer|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Kinter and U.S. House Committee|p=2592}} Players would work for up to eight weeks, risking season- or career-ending injury without pay.

The new association's initial agenda also included a league-wide minimum salary, plus a ''[[per diem]]'' when teams were on the road, a requirement that uniforms and equipment be paid for and maintained at the clubs' expense, and continued payment of salaries when players were injured.&lt;ref name="Part1"/&gt; The NFLPA hoped to meet with Bell during the owners' meeting in January 1957 to discuss the demands; however, no meeting took place.&lt;ref name="Part1"/&gt;

The owners, for their part, were immediately antagonistic to the concept of a player's union — a position epitomized when Miller, then an assistant coach with the [[Cleveland Browns]], was removed from the team's annual photo at the insistence of head coach and general manager [[Paul Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports of The Times; The 'Erased' Labor Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-erased-labor-leader.html|work=The New York Times|author=Anderson, Dave|date=September 2, 1982|accessdate=October 5, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and other union founders were taken aback by Paul Brown's staunch view that "it was both just and necessary that management could cut, trade, bench, blackball, and own in perpetuity anyone and everyone that it wanted".{{sfn|Piascik|p=268}}

Miller continued to represent the NFLPA in their early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Creighton Miller, 79, Lawyer And Notre Dame Halfback|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/sports/creighton-miller-79-lawyer-and-notre-dame-halfback.html|work=The New York Times|author=Goldstein, Richard|date=May 29, 2002|accessdate=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to win the owners' attention by forming the union, the NFLPA threatened to bring an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust lawsuit]] against the league. The antitrust laws are meant to protect "free and fair competition in the marketplace" and prohibit practices that may give industries or businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Division: Antitrust Division Mission |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/about/mission.html |publisher=United States Department of Justice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007221802/http://www.justice.gov/atr/about/mission.html |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than face another lawsuit, the owners agreed to a league minimum salary of $5,000, $50 for each exhibition game played, and medical and hospital coverage.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/about-us/History/|publisher=NFL Players Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011092613/http://www.nflplayers.com/About-us/History/|archivedate=October 11, 2010|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the NFLPA's requests were met, the owners did not enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the association or formally recognize it as the players' exclusive bargaining representative, instead agreeing to change the standard player contract and alter governing documents to reflect the deal.{{sfn|Oriard|p=57}}

From the inception of the NFLPA, its members were divided over whether it should act as a [[professional association]] or a [[Labor union|union]]. Against the wishes of NFLPA presidents [[Pete Retzlaff]] and [[Bernie Parrish]], Miller ran the association as a "'grievance committee'" rather than engaging in collective bargaining.{{sfn|Oriard|p=57}} The standard [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) is a contract between organized workers and management that determines the wages and hours worked by employees and can also determine the scope of one's work and what benefits employees receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Collective Bargaining Agreements Work |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/collective-bargaining-agreement.htm |publisher=HowStuffWorks |author=Roos, Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024031637/http://money.howstuffworks.com/collective-bargaining-agreement.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association continued to use the threat of antitrust litigation over the next few years as a lever to gain better benefits, including a pension plan and health insurance.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

In the 1960s the NFL also faced competition from the new [[American Football League]] (AFL).&lt;ref name="Upstart to Big Time"&gt;{{cite news|title=From upstart to big time, how the AFL changed the NFL |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2009-06-14-sw-afl-cover_N.htm |work=USA Today |author=Bell, Jarrett |date=June 30, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205005857/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2009-06-14-sw-afl-cover_N.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL players viewed the new league as potential leverage for them to improve their contracts. The NFL tried to discourage this idea by changing the owner-controlled [[pension]] plan to add a provision saying that a player would lose his pension if he went to another league.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

On January 14, 1964, players in the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected [[linebacker]] [[Tom Addison]] of the [[Boston Patriots]] as president.&lt;ref name="AFLPA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Players in A.F.L. Form Own Union; Owners to Get Proposals for Pensions, Medical Plan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/16/archives/players-in-afl-form-own-union-owners-to-get-proposals-for-pensions.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 15, 1964|accessdate=September 27, 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than working with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though lack of funding prevented it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use the leverage of being able to sign with an AFL team to attain more money.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

Parrish, upset with the ineffectiveness of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, with the assistance of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT).&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt; The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials of Pro Teams Wary Over the Plans for Union Ties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/02/05/archives/officials-of-pro-teams-wary-over-the-plans-for-union-ties.html?sq=Officials+of+Pro+Teams+Wary+Over+the+Plans+for+Union+Ties&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|work=The New York Times|author=McGowen, Deane|date=February 6, 1966|accessdate=September 26, 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player [[Jim Brown]], began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jim Brown Carries Ball for Pro Union|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/11/10/archives/jim-brown-carries-ball-for-pro-union.html?sq=Jim+Brown+Carries+Ball+for+Pro+Union&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|work=The New York Times|author=Wallace, William N.|date=November 10, 1967|accessdate=September 26, 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in [[Hollywood, Florida]], during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an [[independent union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Football Association Assumes Status of Independent Union; Bid By Teamsters Is Factor In Step|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/11/archives/pro-football-association-assumes-status-of-independent-union-bid-by.html?sq=Pro+Football+Association+Assumes+Status+of+Independent+Union&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|work=The New York Times|author=Wallace, William N.|date=January 11, 1968|accessdate=September 26, 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union.{{sfn|Oriard|p=58}}{{sfn|Brown with Clary|p=250}} He was later replaced by two [[Chicago]] labor lawyers, [[Dan Schulman]] and [[Bernie Baum]].&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

==Recognition and certification (1968–1983)==
Six months after the NFLPA declared itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation teams provided and voted to [[strike action|strike]] on July 3, 1968, after official discussions with the owners stalled.

As the merger of the AFL and NFL became effective in 1970, the unions agreed to meet for the first time in January of that year.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt; The NFL players wanted [[Ed Meador]]—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted [[Jack Kemp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where are they now: Eddie Meador |url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Where-are-they-now-Eddie-Meador.html |publisher=National Football Post |author=Crippen, Ken |date=September 10, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092908/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Where-are-they-now-Eddie-Meador.html |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise was [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]] of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the [[American Football Conference]].

This prompted the players to petition the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) for union certification.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

The players went on strike on July 13, 1970, after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners threatened to cancel the season.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt; Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care was added to the players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial [[arbitration]] for injury grievances.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt; Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt; Attorney [[Ed Garvey]] was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

===1974 strike===
The NFLPA challenged the so-called "Rozelle Rule" as a violation of federal antitrust laws in a lawsuit filed by president [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]] and allied union leaders in 1971.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL labor history since 1968 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=March 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111105327/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule, named after commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], allowed the commissioner to award compensation, which included players, to a team losing a free agent if both the signing team and the team the player was departing could not come to an agreement on compensation.&lt;ref name="Court document"&gt;{{cite web|title=543 F.2d 606: John Mackey et al., Appellees v.

In addition to the "Rozelle Rule", the players demanded the elimination of the [[Reserve clause#NFL|option clause]], impartial arbitration of disputes, elimination of the draft and waiver system and individual, rather than uniform contracts.&lt;ref name="NFLPA history"/&gt;

The strike lasted until August 10, 1974 when the players returned to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the ''Mackey'' lawsuit filed three years before.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|''Mackey v.

The strike occurred because the union demanded that a wage scale based on percentage of [[gross revenue]]s be implemented.

==Gene Upshaw era (1983–2008)==
{{Further|1987 NFL season}}

In 1983, former [[Oakland Raider]] [[Gene Upshaw]] became the executive director of the NFLPA.&lt;ref name="Upshaw"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Upshaw, Union Chief, Dies at 63|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E7DE1F38F931A1575BC0A96E9C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Upshaw+dies&amp;st=nyt|work=The New York Times|author=Battista, Judy|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, he oversaw a player strike, several antitrust lawsuits, and the collective bargaining agreement of 1993.

The NFLPA went on strike for a month in 1987 upon the expiration of the 1982 CBA; the league's free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL Lockout: History-1987 Strike |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/topics/_/page/nfl-labor-negotiations |publisher=ESPN |date=August 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123064017/http://espn.go.com/nfl/topics/_/page/nfl-labor-negotiations |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of [[1987 NFL season|the season]]. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams,&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merrill strike"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL replacements part of history |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6642330 |publisher=ESPN |author=Merrill, Elizabeth |date=June 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612225126/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6642330 |archivedate=June 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from the closure of the [[United States Football League]] two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], who had folded just three months prior to the strike). They were joined by a few veterans who crossed the picket lines,&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; including [[New York Jets]] defensive end [[Mark Gastineau]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] defensive tackle [[Randy White (American football)|Randy White]], [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]], [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Doug Flutie]], and [[Seattle Seahawks]] wide receiver [[Steve Largent]].&lt;ref name="Merrill strike"/&gt;

Given the willingness of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five worst labor disputes in sports |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2011/0311/Five-worst-labor-disputes-in-sports/1987-NFL-Strike-Sept.-22-Oct.-15 |work=The Christian Science Monitor |author=Couch, Aaron |date=March 11, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903072629/http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2011/0311/Five-worst-labor-disputes-in-sports/1987-NFL-Strike-Sept.-22-Oct.-15 |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL Players Strike: Day 23: Raiders: Hilger and 10 Other Players Cross Line, Go Back to Work |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-15/sports/sp-14301_1_nfl-players |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Roberts, Rich |date=October 15, 1987 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915202114/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-15/sports/sp-14301_1_nfl-players |archivedate=September 15, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge [[David S. Doty|David Doty]] to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

On November 1, 1989, the [[Court of Appeals]] rejected the suit on the grounds that the owners were covered by the labor exemption from antitrust law.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; The union's next tactic, in November 1989, was to disclaim any interest in representing NFL players in collective bargaining and to reform itself as a professional organization. Having done that, individual players, led by [[Freeman McNeil]] of the New York Jets, brought a new antitrust action, challenging the NFL's so-called "[[Plan B free agency|Plan B]]" free agency, which gave teams a right of first refusal to sign a player, as an unlawful practice under the antitrust acts.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Freeman McNeil sees history repeating in NFL labor dispute |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-31-freeman-mcneil-nfl-labor_N.htm |work=USA Today |author=Bell, Jarrett |date=April 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405071454/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-31-freeman-mcneil-nfl-labor_N.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The players ultimately prevailed after a jury trial on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases and the threat of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed by [[Reggie White]], then with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; In return, the owners received a [[salary cap]], albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floor&amp;mdash;minimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBA extension latest accomplishment for Upshaw |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2387218 |publisher=ESPN |author=Garber, Greg |date=August 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112074934/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2387218 |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 30&amp;ndash;2 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

In May 2008, the owners decided to opt out of the 1993 arrangement, per the agreement with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010.&lt;ref name="Opt out"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL owners vote unanimously to opt out of labor deal |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3404596 |publisher=ESPN |author=Clayton, John |date=May 20, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201204737/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3404596 |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Drew Brees]].&lt;ref name="FoxSports"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL owners lock out players |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/NFL-Players-Association-union-decertifies-labor-talks-owners-031111 |publisher=Fox Sports |author=Marvex, Alex |date=March 11, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814084913/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/NFL-Players-Association-union-decertifies-labor-talks-owners-031111 |archivedate=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Court judge [[Susan Richard Nelson]] granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge sides with players, tells NFL to end lockout |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/04/judge-sides-with-players-tells-nfl-to-end-lockout/1#.UG24nVGoXIV |work=USA Today |author=Leahy, Sean |date=April 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012025857/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/04/judge-sides-with-players-tells-nfl-to-end-lockout/1 |archivedate=October 12, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]]; Nelson refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge refuses to delay enforcing order to lift NFL lockout |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-players-ask-judge-to-enforce-end-of-lockout/2011/04/27/AF9Cj30E_story.html |work=The Washington Post |author=Maske, Mark |date=April 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321142613/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-players-ask-judge-to-enforce-end-of-lockout/2011/04/27/AF9Cj30E_story.html |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL Lockout Is Reinstated |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703567404576293823161700258 |work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Futterman, Matthew |date=April 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504031034/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703567404576293823161700258.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eighth Circuit [[vacated judgment|vacated]] Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL lockout: Eighth Circuit vacates lower court's injunction, legalizing lockout |url=http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2011/07/nfl_lockout_eighth_circuit_vac.html |publisher=NJ.com |author=The Associated Press |date=July 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022190415/http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2011/07/nfl_lockout_eighth_circuit_vac.html |archivedate=October 22, 2013 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With NFL fields shuttered, players left to train on their own |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-15-players-traning_N.htm |work=USA Today |author=Corbett, Jim |date=March 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020150743/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-15-players-traning_N.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2013 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|New Orleans Saints bounty scandal}}

The NFLPA, on behalf of [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]], [[Scott Fujita]] and [[Anthony Hargrove]], three players suspended due to the [[Bountygate]] investigation by the NFL, filed a lawsuit against the league. The investigation found that [[New Orleans Saints]] players were allegedly paid bonuses for hits that injured opposing players. The players' lawsuit claimed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] "had violated the league's labor agreement by showing he had pre-determined the guilt of the players punished in the bounty probe before serving as the arbitrator for their June 18 appeal hearing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFLPA, Vilma Make More Legal Moves in Bounty Case |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nflpa-files-suit-bounty-matter-16715791 |publisher=ABC News |author=Martel, Brett |date=July 5, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708171108/http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nflpa-files-suit-bounty-matter-16715791 |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspensions were unanimously overturned by a three-member appeals panel; however, the ruling did not permanently void their suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bounty players' bans overturned |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8349080/sources-suspensions-jonathan-vilma-smith-scott-fujita-anthony-hargrove-overturned-arbitration-panel |publisher=ESPN |author=Schefter, Adam; Ed Werder and The Associated Press |date=September 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908050605/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8349080/sources-suspensions-jonathan-vilma-smith-scott-fujita-anthony-hargrove-overturned-arbitration-panel |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |accessdate=September 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL appointed former commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] to review the NFL's sanctions against the players, which he overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Tagliabue vacates penalties |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8736662/paul-tagliabue-vacates-new-orleans-players-bounty-penalties |publisher=ESPN |author=Associated Press |date=December 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211212442/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8736662/paul-tagliabue-vacates-new-orleans-players-bounty-penalties |archivedate=December 11, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NFLPA's Department of Labor records since 2006, when membership classifications were first reported, around 60%, or almost two thirds, of the union's membership are classified as "former players," and not eligible to vote in the union, "because, as a matter of federal law, they cannot be members of the collective bargaining unit." The other, voting eligible, classifications are "active players" and "associates."&lt;ref name="OLMS"/&gt; {{As of|2014}} this accounts for 3,130 "former player" members (59% of total), 1,959 "active players" (37%), and 207 "associate" members (4%).&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2014-05-29"&gt;{{Cite OLMS|filenum=065-533|rptId=556933|rptForm=LM2Form|date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="934">The '''Cybex test''' is a fitness examination that is usually given to prospective [[National Football League]] players who are entering the [[NFL Draft]]. It primarily tests the joint movement of prospects. Each test taker is connected to a special machine that collects and computes information into ratings that are analyzed by experts and coaches. The name is likely derived from the original fitness equipment manufacturer [[Cybex International]] and continues today with the current manufacturer [https://csmisolutions.com/products/isokinetic-extremity-systems/humac-norm HUMAC NORM].  The Cybex Test is more recently known as Isokinetic Testing and is utilized in post surgical extremity rehabilitation protocols.

A '''coaching tree''' is similar to a [[family tree]] except that it shows the relationships of [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] instead of family members. There are several different ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.

Coaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.

The phrase "coaching tree" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.

Coaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

20 years later, in 2018, an [[ESPN]] article showed visually how 28 of the 32 coaches who would serve as NFL head coaches in the upcoming season were connected to head coaches [[Bill Parcells]] and [[Bill Belichick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill &amp; Bill Connections|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only team that wasn't profiled in this particular story was the [[Indianapolis Colts]], who hadn't yet hired a head coach at the time of the article. The Colts would eventually hire [[Frank Reich]]. The only 3 NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]; [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]]; and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.

Coaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.

==Philosophical tree connections==
Coaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their protégé. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:

*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.
*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].
*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del Río got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].

Additionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.
*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.

The '''20-yard shuttle''', also simply called '''the short shuttle''', is a test performed by [[American football]] athletes at the [[NFL combine]]. It is primarily run to evaluate the quickness and change-of-direction ability of players by [[Scout (sport)|scouts]], particularly  for the [[NFL Draft]] but also for [[college football|collegiate]] [[Recruiting (athletics)|recruiting]]. Although not as highly regarded a test as the [[40-yard dash]], it is still an important barometer used by NFL personnel to compare players. [[Canadian football]] also uses the shuttle test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/combine-drills|title=Prospect Central|website=CFL|accessdate=August 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919110755/http://cfl.ca/page/combine-drills|archive-date=September 19, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The drill ==
The name "20-yard shuttle" is derived from the total yards that athletes travel during the drill. This drill is also known as the "short shuttle" or the "5-10-5" drill." The athlete starts at the center cone of 3 cones, each a distance of 5 yards apart.  The athlete then pushes off their dominant leg in the opposite direction for 5 yards and touches the line. After covering this distance and touching the line as quickly as possible, the athlete must reverse and go 10 yards in the opposite direction and again touch the line. Finally, they reverse direction again, ending the drill at the starting point after traveling another 5 yards. The procedure is timed and the athlete starts the drill on reaction to the word "Go" as announced by the person starting the stopwatch. The NFL Scouting Combine allows each participant three opportunities to run the drill, and the best time of the three attempts is recorded as that players' time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportznutz.com/nfl/draft/combine.htm |title=NFL Scouting Combine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=August 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806042347/http://www.sportznutz.com/nfl/draft/combine.htm |archive-date=August 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 20-yard shuttle drill is designed to measure short area quickness, lateral movement, flexibility and the speed at which a player can change directions.  The drill also gives scouts an idea of how well a player can keep a low center of gravity as well as their ability to sink their hips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nflcombineresults.com/nfl-combine-drills-101-what-each-drill-measures NFL Combine Drills Explained ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:49ers training camp 2010-08-09 28.JPG|thumb|The [[San Francisco 49ers]] conducting training camp at the team's headquarters and practice facility in [[Santa Clara, California]] in August 2010]]
In the [[National Football League]], '''training camp''' refers to the time before the season commences. During this time, teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location, usually a university, to conduct [[training camp]] for at least the first few weeks. This is similar to [[baseball]]'s [[spring training]].

Training camp is used in several different ways. New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems. For younger players, it serves as a period of evaluation; for veterans, it is time to round back into form.

Training camp is divided into several different components. The first is scrimmages. These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games' worth of plays. Sometimes, two practice sessions are held on the same day. This concept is referred to as ''two-a-days''. Other parts of training camp include drills, meetings with coaches and other players at one's position, [[weight training]], and pre-season games.

The latter half of training camp leads directly into the [[National Football League exhibition season|exhibition season]].

With NFL training camps starting in late-July, the biggest concern has been dehydration. In 2001, [[Minnesota Vikings]] player [[Korey Stringer]] died of a medical condition based from [[dehydration]] and [[heatstroke]]. The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies. At each practice, every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field; additionally, an ambulance must be present during practices.

With NFL training camps beginning in late July, severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games. In 2002, a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps.

Fans are often able to visit their favorite team's training camp to catch an early look at the players; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket, making training camp trips a popular option for fans who cannot attend many games due to financial or other reasons. NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience.

Official NFL training camps should be distinguished from private training camps, often for certain tactics or positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steveclarksondreammaker.com/quarterback-camp Quarterback Camp]. [[Steve Clarkson]] Dreammaker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized team activities==
Recently the NFL has let teams have off-season training sessions, officially called "organized team activities" (OTAs). Many teams use the OTAs to help develop players and make them better. These training sessions are in late May and early June.&lt;ref&gt;https://247sports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/ContentGallery/NFL-offseason-FAQ-The-difference-between-OTAs-minicamp-more-118396909/#118396909_2&lt;/ref&gt; The OTAs are the only practices between the end of the previous season and the start of training camp. Players new to the NFL attend seminars and lectures organized by the NFL from mid-June to mid-July. For veteran players, they use the off-time to sponsor football camps for children, [[golf]] outings for charity, or even some family time.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Differences with baseball==
Unlike [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], where teams congregate at locations in two states (Arizona and Florida), NFL teams train all over the [[United States]]. However, an increasing number of teams do so in the same facilities at which they practice all year long – 19 teams in 2014, and 20 in 2015, up from five in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/more-nfl-teams-opting-for-comforts-of-home-over-going-away-for-training-camp-new-york-giants-philadelphia-eagles-072613|title=More teams staying home for camp|author=|date=26 July 2013|website=foxsports.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams have abandoned remote locations to "come home" for training camp, largely for practicality reasons. Many clubs have recently constructed state-of-the-art headquarters and practice facilities, replete with amenities (multiple practice fields, indoor practice fields, weightlifting rooms, meeting rooms, lecture halls, film study rooms, offices, cafeteria, medical facilities, IT infrastructure, media/press conference room, etc.) that can not be provided or matched at other distant locations (colleges, parks, etc.). Most if not all of these newer team practice facilities were in fact designed with hosting training camp in mind, and they are able to accommodate the expanded training camp roster sizes. Some even feature permanent bleachers for spectators. In addition, the cost of temporarily relocating and accommodating the entire team organization to another location is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2527998-why-are-nfl-teams-no-longer-traveling-for-training-camp|title=Why Are NFL Teams No Longer Traveling for Training Camp?|first=Brad|last=Gagnon|date=|website=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitudes about how to run training camp have also evolved - leading more teams to stay home. Furthermore, restrictions dictated by the [[NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement|CBA]] ([[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]]) limit contact and prohibit such things [[Two-a-days (football)|two-a-days]], which effectively reduces on-field activity during camp. With ''Organized Team Activities'' ("OTAs"), mini-camps, and conditioning during the off-season, players remain in top physical shape year-round. The focus of training camp is no longer getting players back in shape, but more of fostering camaraderie and delving immediately into game prep.

For example, the Lions' camp was long held at [[Saginaw Valley State College]], the Broncos trained at the [[University of Northern Colorado]], the Patriots at [[Bryant University]] in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]], and the Redskins moved in from [[Dickinson College]], the former site of [[Carlisle Indian School]]. Tampa Bay used to train at the [[University of Tampa]], then at the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex]] before moving permanently back to their headquarters. Similarly, after many years on the road, the [[New York Jets|Jets]] ([[State University of New York at Cortland|SUNY Cortland]]) and the [[New York Giants|Giants]] ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]) both recently moved back to team headquarters.

There are still a handful of teams that use somewhat distant locations at the fringes of their markets to promote their team. For instance, the [[Buffalo Bills]] moved their training camp from [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]] to [[Saint John Fisher College]] in suburban [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; as a team representing one of the smallest cities in the NFL, the holding of training camp in the nearby city of Rochester allows the Bills to lay claim to a larger portion of [[upstate New York]] and thus take advantage of a market closer in size to other teams in the NFL (similar rationale was used for the [[Bills Toronto Series|Bills' games in Toronto, Ontario, Canada]] prior to 2014). The Dallas Cowboys have historically hosted their training camp in locales very distant from their home market, even before they were given the moniker "[[America's Team]]" in the late 1970s. The Cowboys have held their training camp at the River Ridge Playing Fields in [[Oxnard, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles, off and on since 2004. Despite the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] returning to southern California and the Cowboys constructing a [[The Ford Center at The Star|considerable multi-purpose facility]] in [[Frisco, Texas]] whose main lure is being the team's practice facility, the Cowboys continue have held the early part of their training camp in Oxnard annually since 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Rob |title=Practice Schedule for Training Camp in Oxnard |url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/practice-schedule-for-training-camp-in-oxnard |website=DallasCowboys.com |accessdate=13 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another difference between spring training and training camp is that true intra-squad games do not take place (anymore), though informal scrimmages are very common. Split-squad games never happen in the NFL. It is also fairly common to see two teams hold a short joint camp and scrimmage at a neutral site in addition to their main camp.

The [[National Football League]] has enjoyed success in selling out many of their venues from season ticket sales alone. Out of 32 teams in the league, 24 claim to have waiting lists from under 1,000 people to over 150,000. For some fans, this means a wait not just of years, but decades. This is due mostly to the NFL's short window of play; there are only eight regular-season home games, forcing the most devoted fans into a desperate and sometimes costly search for a limited number of events.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/09/07/nfl-football-tickets-forbeslife-cx_ls_0907tickets.html | work=Forbes | title=Toughest NFL Waiting Lists - Forbes.com | date=2007-09-07 | first=Lauren | last=Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1973 to 2014, the waiting lists also had the by-product of preventing any home games of certain teams from being [[National Football League television blackout policies|blacked out on local television]]. Under the league's blackout policy, home games were required to be sold out within 72 hours of kickoff before a telecast was allowed, and the longest waiting lists have ensured every home game of the applicable teams being locally televised. Prior to 1973, home games could not be locally televised even if they were sold out. Four teams have had the benefit of not seeing any blackouts ''at all'' since 1972 (excluding playoff games, which are not covered under season ticket purchases). This restriction was lifted by the FCC in October 2014, and the league followed suit by suspending its blackout policy for 2015.

== Personal seat licenses (PSLs) ==
A [[personal seat license]] (PSL) is a license which grants the holder the right to buy season tickets for a particular team. PSLs were first used in the NFL by the expansion [[Carolina Panthers]] in 1993 to help finance [[Bank of America Stadium|their new stadium]]. Since that time, several teams have used the mechanism to finance new stadium projects including the [[Chicago Bears]] remodel of [[Soldier Field]] and more recently the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  The [[New York Jets]] and the [[New York Giants]] used PSL programs to finance the construction of the New Meadowlands Stadium, now [[MetLife Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Meadowlands Stadium opens to Giants, Jets fans in East Rutherford |first=Rohan |last=Mascarenhas |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/new_meadowlands_stadium_opens.html |newspaper=The Star-Ledger |location=Newark |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism related to waiting lists ==
In 2003, the [[New York Jets]] changed their waiting list policy to require a $50 annual maintenance fee to remain on the waiting list. However, due to the long list of names and high renewal rates among existing ticket holders, there was uncertainty about the fees a person may possibly have to pay if they remained on the list for many years. After attention from the media and the [[New York Attorney General]]'s Office, the Jets agreed to cap the maintenance fees at $500, allow the transfer of the waiting list position if the person moved out of state and provide at least 80% of non-renewed season tickets to waiting list members. In 2008, the Jets sent notices to those on the waiting list that the $50 annual maintenance fee would be waived and any money already accrued would be either refunded or credited toward the purchase of Jets merchandise.

In 2004, the [[New England Patriots]], who have a substantial season ticket waiting list, received media attention for not allowing the son of a deceased season ticket holder to retain his father's season tickets.  The following year, the [[New England Patriots]] introduced the "Pass It On" transfer program, which allows season ticket holders to transfer season tickets to immediate family members for $2,000 to $5,000 per ticket, depending on the location of the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/02/25/season_ticket_transfer_fees_irk_fans/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Season ticket transfer fees irk fans | date=2005-02-25 | first1=Bruce | last1=Mohl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL requires that season ticket purchasers not only purchase the regular season games, but also typically two preseason games whether they want the exhibition games or not. The legality of requiring the purchase of the preseason games has been challenged all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] but it has not resulted in a change of policy for the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Angelo F. Coniglio v.

== Lengthiest waiting lists ==
[[Image:Waitlist Postcard.jpg|thumb|Annual postcard sent out by the Green Bay Packers organization to those on the waiting list for season tickets]]
The Green Bay Packers have the longest waiting list, with more than 130,000 names. The team's website says the wait is 30 years.&lt;ref name="packtix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packers.com/fan-zone/faq.html |title=Packers.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a common custom in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and other [[Wisconsin]] cities to put a baby's name on the list as soon as the birth certificate is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/fan_zone/faq/#tickets|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318031051/http://www.packers.com/fan_zone/faq/|url-status=dead|title=Packers.com - Fan Zone - Faq - Tickets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archivedate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Waitlist Postcard.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/rick_reilly/10/09/reilly1015/index.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Be the 74,659th In Line! - Oct 9, 2007 | date=2007-10-09 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transfer of standing to surviving relatives is permitted by the Packers.&lt;ref name="packtix"/&gt;

The [[Washington Redskins]] were reported to have the longest waiting list, with more than 150,000 names. However, recent investigations question whether a waiting list exists at all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/117909 | work=The Washington Examiner | title=Redskins season ticket waiting list is a mystery to fans, sports experts | date=2011-09-01 | first1=Liz| last1=Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem to be contradicted by the fact that [[FedExField]] demolished 10,000 seats heading into the 2011 season, and has since removed many upper deck sections. The [[New York Giants]], [[New York Jets]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Denver Broncos]] historically have also maintained long waiting lists for season tickets.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The '''Super Bowl Experience''' (formerly the '''NFL Experience''') is an annual event which has been held since 1992 at a venue in the host city of the [[Super Bowl]]. The event is described as an interactive "[[theme park]]",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/la-gets-nfl-experience-39471/|title=L.A.

In November 2017, the NFL opened an NFL Experience attraction at [[New York City]]'s [[20 Times Square]], in collaboration with [[Cirque du Soleil]], which featured a similar array of interactive experiences and memorabilia. Consequently, the NFL began to refer to the travelling event as the ''Super Bowl Experience'' beginning in 2018 for [[Super Bowl LII]] in [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]]. The Times Square experience was later closed.

==History==
The first NFL Experience was held at the [[Minneapolis Convention Center]] in January 1992 prior to [[Super Bowl XXVI]].  The NFL's interactive theme park was followed by [[Major League Baseball]]'s first "FanFest" in [[San Diego, California]] six months later.

In 2013 the NFL Experience was hosted at the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]].&lt;ref name="fan"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fanhospitality.com/nfl-experience |title= NFL Experience |author= |date=|website= fanhospitality.com|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2017 |quote= s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL Experience was not held for [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. Instead, the NFL organized an outdoor festival, Super Bowl Boulevard, along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Times Square]], which featured a similar array of fan-oriented events and attractions (such as an artificial toboggan hill).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2014/01/23/super-bowl-xlviii-seattle-seahawks-denver-broncos-new-jersey-new-york/4806375/|title=New Jersey takes backseat in Super Bowl XLVIII billing|work=USA Today|access-date=November 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/01/super_bowl_2014_super_bowl_boulevard.html|title=Super Bowl 2014 fan guide: NFL 'Boulevard' on Broadway|work=NJ.com|access-date=November 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2013/2/12/3980680/2014-super-bowl-new-york-nfl-experience-nixed |title= 2014 Super Bowl will not have NFL Experience in New York|author= Jeff Briggs|date=February 13, 2013|website= |publisher=[[ SB Nation]]|access-date=November 1, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 NFL Experience was hosted at the [[Phoenix Convention Center]].&lt;ref name="fan" /&gt;

The 2016 NFL Experience was hosted at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=nbcbayarea&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Chris|title=Super Bowl 50 Gets Financial Boost from Big Tech|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/Super-Bowl-50-Gets-Boost-From-Bay-Area-Tech-Companies--262055291.html|work=NBC Bay Area|publisher=NBCUniversal Media|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 NFL Experience was hosted at [[George R. Brown Convention Center]] in Houston. The Houston Super Bowl Host Committee also hosted its own outdoor festival, ''Super Bowl Live'', in the adjacent [[Discovery Green]] park, which featured entertainment events.&lt;ref name="hpress-sblive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl LIVE Kicks Off at Discovery Green|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/super-bowl-live-kicks-off-at-discovery-green-9128633|website=Houston Press|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Barron of the Houston Chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=David|title=Super Bowl LI "Opening Night" at Minute Maid on Jan. 30|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Super-Bowl-LI-Opening-Night-at-Minute-Maid-on-10620658.php|website=Houston Chronicle.com|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NFL Experience Times Square ==
On November 30, 2017, the NFL opened an attraction known as '''NFL Experience Times Square''', within four ground-level floors of [[20 Times Square]] in New York City. The 40,000 square-foot attraction was a collaboration with [[Cirque du Soleil|Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group]], and featured various interactive activities and multimedia experiences, including a [[4D film]], a simulated locker room and practice area, displays of memorabilia, and a bar and restaurant that would feature a rotation of menu selections from NFL stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/hotels-resorts/hotel-openings/marriot-edition-hotel-times-square-ian-schrager|title=This New Times Square Hotel Will Be Wrapped in New York City's Biggest Billboard|work=Travel &amp; Leisure|access-date=November 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/the-future-of-cirque-du-soleil-isn-t-the-circus|title=The Future of Cirque du Soleil Isn’t the Circus|date=November 29, 2017|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/news/nfl-times-square-cirque-du-soleil-1201802172/|title=Cirque du Soleil, NFL Team Up For Massive Times Square Attraction|last=Cox|first=Gordon|date=June 23, 2016|work=Variety|access-date=November 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/30/16716970/nfl-experience-times-square-football-theme-park-fans|title=The NFL opened up a football theme park in the middle of Times Square|work=SBNation.com|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, it was announced that [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[Good Morning Football]]'' would move to a studio at the attraction in April, after having previously used a [[CBS]] studio in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/good-morning-football-moving-from-cbs-to-nfl-experience-times-square.html|title=Good Morning Football moving to new NFL Experience in Times Square|date=February 13, 2018|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=February 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, it was announced that the attraction would close, citing underperforming attendance numbers (which analysts pegged to poor promotion by the NFL, and high ticket prices). It was to remain open through at least the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/325529/nfl-experience-sacked-during-first-year-opening-dr.html|title=NFL Experience Sacked During First-Year Opening Drive|work=MediaPost|language=en|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2018/11/26/Facilities/NFL-Experience.aspx|title=NFL Experience Still Open In Times Square Through End Of Year|website=Sports Business Daily|language=en|access-date=November 26, 2018}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Good Morning Football'' moved to [[SportsNet New York]]'s facilities at [[4 World Trade Center]] in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dachman |first1=Jason |title=NFL Media Ramps Up for Exclusive London Broadcast; Good Morning Football Preps for Move to SNY |url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2018/10/26/nfl-media-ramps-up-for-exclusive-london-broadcast-good-morning-football-preps-for-move-to-sny/ |website=Sports Video Group |accessdate=November 5, 2018 |date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test''' (formerly '''Wonderlic Personnel Test''') is a popular group intelligence test used to assess the learning and problem-solving [[aptitude]] of prospective employees for a range of occupations. The Wonderlic is available in 12 different languages and is often used for college, entry level jobs, and team-making evaluation.  It consists of 50 multiple choice questions to be answered in 12 minutes.&lt;ref name=Aiken1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Aiken|first=L.

The test is available both online and in printed form, whereas the original test was only available on paper. The Wonderlic test was based on the Otis Self-Administering Test of Mental Ability.&lt;ref name="Aiken1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazmier1959&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kazmier|first=Leonard J.|author2=Browne, C .J. |title=Comparability of Wonderlic Test Forms in Industrial Testing|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1959|volume=43|issue=2|pages=129–132|doi=10.1037/h0045688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Created in 1936 by E. F. Wonderlic, the Wonderlic Personnel Test was the first short-form cognitive abilities test.&lt;ref name="Pollick2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title= History|url= http://www.wonderlic.com/about-us/history|website=wonderlic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to measure [[g factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability]] in the areas of math, vocabulary, and reasoning.&lt;ref name="Pollick2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Wonderlic created and distributed it as a graduate student in the psychology department at [[Northwestern University]] from his home.&lt;ref name="Merron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Regarding the time allotted to take the test, Eldon F. Wonderlic, in an article released in 1939, stated the following: "The length of the test was made such that only about two to five per cent of average groups complete the test in the twelve-minute time limit."&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1939"/&gt;

Originally designed to aid in employee selection, the Wonderlic Personnel Test has also been used by both the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[National Football League]] for selection purposes. During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.&lt;ref name="Pollick2003"/&gt; It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.&lt;ref name="Pollick2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time. It may be termed as a quick IQ test.&lt;ref name="tests.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personality and Aptitude Career Tests. (2004). "Wonderlic personnel test: A short and quick iq test|accessdate=November 20, 2012 |url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/wonderlic-personnel-test.html|website=personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wonderlic test is continually being updated with repeated evaluations of questions.&lt;ref name="wonderlic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GARDNERLINDZEY19491101"/&gt; Also, beginning in the 1970s, Wonderlic began to develop other forms of the Wonderlic Personnel some of which include: Wonderlic Perceptual Ability Tests, Wonderlic Scholastic Level Exam, or the Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test. There are currently 30 tests offered by Wonderlic, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|title= Wonderlic Product Matrix|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/wonderlic-product-matrix}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Types==
The tests are divided into four different sections: [[cognitive]], skill, personality, and [[behaviorism|behavioral]]. The scores are predictors of the possible conformity that a potential employee has within the field for which they are applying. Each test has a different number of questions and time requirement, and either can or cannot be administered via computer.

===Skill===
Created in the 1950s by Wonderlic's son, Charles F Wonderlic Sr., the skills test measures an individual's skill in areas such as math or English.&lt;ref name=VLord89&gt;[http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/wonderlic-scholastic-level-exam.html Wonderlic Scholastic Level Exam], access date March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of skill tests: Perceptual Ability Test, Wonderlic Basic Skills Test, and Wonderlic Office and Software Skills Tests. The Wonderlic Perceptual Ability Tests measures an individual's ability to answer numerical and alphabetical details with [[accuracy]]. The Wonderlic Basic Skills Test measures one's mathematical and verbal capabilities. Wonderlic Office and Software Skills Tests test a person's computer proficiency and use of basic software.&lt;ref name="wonderlic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/ |title=Ready. Test. Go |publisher=Wonderlic |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive Ability (Wonderlic Personnel Test &amp; Wonderlic SLE)===
Released in the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personnel Test measures an individual's capability of solving problems and learning. The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test - Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability. The Wonderlic Personnel Test is a much more comprehensive test.&lt;ref name="wonderlic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wonderlic Test – Cognitive Ability Test|url=http://www.allpracticetest.org/wonderlic-exams/wonderlic-test-cognitive-ability-tests/|publisher=All Practice Test|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wonderlic SLE is the scholastic version of the Wonderlic Personnel Test and is commonly administered to nursing school and medical program applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://beatthewonderlic.com/blogs/news/what-is-the-wonderlic|title=What Is the Wonderlic?|work=Beat the Wonderlic|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral liability===
Behavioral Liability is a test assessment for individuals to gauge that individual's potential in engaging in counterproductive or unethical behaviors within a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martocchio|first=Joseph|author2=Judge, Timothy A |title=Relationship between conscientiousness and learning in employee training|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=October 1997|volume=82|issue=5|pages=764–773|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/82/5/764/|accessdate=April 12, 2012|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.82.5.764|pmid=9337608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divided into two sections: the Wonderlic Behavioral Risk Profile and the Wonderlic Behavioral Risk Profile Plus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.allpracticetest.org/wonderlic-exams/wonderlic-test-behavioral-reliability-tests/ Wonderlic Behavioral Test], access date March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Each test measures an individual's liability within the group, e.g., theft. The Wonderlic Behavioral Risk Profile test an individual's three [[trait theory|behavior traits]]: [[neuroticism]], [[agreeability]], and [[conscientiousness]]. The Wonderlic Behavioral Risk Profile Plus is similar to the Wonderlic Behavioral [[Risk]] Profile, however the Wonderlic Behavioral Risk Profile Plus contains additional questioning including background disclosures and productivity results.&lt;ref name="wonderlic" /&gt;

===Personality===
The Wonderlic Personality tests measure personal characteristics that are widely accepted as being predictive of a candidate's expected [[job performance]]. Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wonderlic|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/assessments/personality|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Added during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.

The Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on seven dimensions different from the Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile: [[emotion|emotional intensity]], [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[motivation|recognition motivation]], [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]], [[assertiveness]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[Impression management|good impression]]. The Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile test is oriented more for [[customer service]] employees.&lt;ref name="wonderlic" /&gt;

==Sample questions==
Similar to other [[standardized test]]s, the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test presents its questions in an open response format that becomes increasingly more difficult as one progresses through the test.&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1939"/&gt; The types of questions that have appeared in the oldest versions of the Wonderlic test include: [[analogy|analogies]], analysis of geometric figures, [[arithmetic]], direction following, disarranged sentences, [[judgment]], [[logic]], [[proverb|proverb matching]], similarities, and word definitions. However, the questions may take different angles depending upon the ‘intelligence’ of the question setters.
&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tests.com"/&gt; Practice questions will include:
* If a piece of rope cost 20 cents per 2 feet, how many feet can you buy for 30 dollars?
* Which of the numbers in this group represents the smallest amount? a) 0.3 b) 0.08 c) 1 d) 0.33
* A high-speed train travels 25 feet in 1/3 second.

==Application to industrial-organizational psychology==
{{See also|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
The Wonderlic test, as a vocational and intelligence test, falls under the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. As a personnel test the Wonderlic is used to gauge an applicant's job potential, educational potential, and training potential.&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1983"/&gt; Six forms of this test are made available (A, B, C, D, E, and F) in which Wonderlic suggests that when two of these versions are to be used, the best combinations are A and B or D and F.&lt;ref name="Kazmier"&gt;Kazmier, L.J. &amp; Browne C.G.(1959). Comparability of Wonderlic test forms in industrial testing. Journal of Applied Psychology. 43(2):129–132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study conducted by psychologists Kazmier and Browne (1959) shows that neither of these forms can be regarded as directly equivalent.&lt;ref name="Kazmier" /&gt; While there is no lack of tests that could be used in place of the Wonderlic, such as the IQ or the Mechanical Aptitude Test, it is a quick and simple vocational test for personnel recruitment and selection.&lt;ref name=GARDNERLINDZEY19491101&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=123&amp;sid=e11e7c61-c644-4ba8-993b-82d253c55a5f%40sessionmgr12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=1949-05522-001 | title=Remarks on the use of the Wonderlic Personnel Test as a 'pre-test.'| work=Journal of Clinical Psychology| date=November 1, 1949 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | author= Lindzey, Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wonderlic test has been peer reviewed by the [[American Psychological Association]] and has been deemed worthy of field applications to the industrial use of personnel testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobrill|first=Carl|author2=Warner, Holly |title=Further studies of the Wonderlic Personnel Test as a brief measure of intelligence|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=February 1988|volume=56|pages=145–147|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ccp/56/1/145/|issue=1|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.56.1.145|pmid=3346441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources can be found on the database APA PsycNET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.defaultSearchForm|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reliability==
{{See also|Reliability (statistics)}}
In 1982, Carl Dodrill conducted a study in which 57 adults were administered the Wonderlic twice over a five-year period. In the ''[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]]'', Dodrill reported that the test-retest reliability for the Wonderlic was .94.&lt;ref name=Dodrill1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodrill|first=Carl|title=Long-Term Reliability of the Wonderlic Personnel Test|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1983|volume=51|issue=2|pages=316–317|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.51.2.316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Weaver and Boneau reported in the ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'' that two of the five forms, A and B, that were published at the time were harder than the others which caused scores on those forms to be significantly lower than scores obtained on forms C–F.&lt;ref name="Weaver1956"/&gt; Concerning these observed differences, Weaver and Boneau state: "This accords with the history of the development of the test. Forms D, E, and F are made up of items selected from the Otis Higher, while A and B were developed later and include types of items not found in the Otis."&lt;ref name="Weaver1956"/&gt; Those findings, seemingly, invalidate the claim that those forms were equivalent or consistent.&lt;ref name="Weaver1956"/&gt; E. N. Hay made a similar observation as well. Hay found that form F was significantly easier than Form D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=E. N.|title=Some research findings with the Wonderlic Personnel Test|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1952|volume=36|issue=5|pages=344–345|doi=10.1037/h0061766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kazmier found Form B to be the most difficult of the five forms and, thus, recommended that it "not be regarded as directly equivalent to any of the forms."&lt;ref name="Kazmier1959"/&gt; Kazmier also found Forms D and F to be significantly different from each other and recommended that these forms be regarded as inequivalent.&lt;ref name="Kazmier1959"/&gt; In a study of the Wonderlic's test-retest reliability, conducted in 1992, Stuart McKelvie "concluded that conscious repetition of specific responses did not seriously inflate the estimate of test-retest reliability."&lt;ref name= McKelvie1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKelvie|first=Stuart J.|title=Does memory contaminate test-retest reiliability|journal=Journal of General Psychology|date=January 1992|volume=119|issue=1|pages=59–72|doi=10.1080/00221309.1992.9921158|pmid=1613489}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put it simply, one's memory of some of the answers does not significantly affect one's score on the Wonderlic.&lt;ref name="McKelvie1992"/&gt;

More recently, according to a 1989 article in ''[[Psychological Reports]]'', the Wonderlic scored a r=.87 on the reliability scale compared along with the Pearson test score of r=.21.&lt;ref name=Matthews2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=T|author2=Kerry S. Lassiter |title=WHAT DOES THE WONDERLIC PERSONNEL TEST MEASURE?|journal=Psychological Reports|year=2007|volume=100|pages=707–712|doi=10.2466/pr0.100.3.707-712|issue=3|pmid=17688083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Validity==
{{See also|Validity (statistics)}}
In an article written in ''[[Psychological Reports]]'', T. Matthews and Kerry Lassiter report that the Wonderlic test "was most strongly associated with overall intellectual functioning," which is what it is purported to measure.&lt;ref name="Matthews2007" /&gt; However, Matthews and Lassiter did not find the Wonderlic to be a successful measure of [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]], and they stated that "the Wonderlic test scores did not clearly show convergent or divergent validity evidence across these two broad domains of cognitive ability."&lt;ref name="Matthews2007" /&gt; In academic testing, the Wonderlic test has shown high correlations with aptitude tests such as the General Aptitude Test Battery.&lt;ref name="Matthews2007" /&gt;
==Legal Issues==
===''Jordan v. New London''===
In May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as "Too Smart To Be A Cop".[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/][https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html], based on the City's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.

Jordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In the fall of 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. 

Jordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: "The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection." [http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html] The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].

==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==
{{See also|Central tendency}}
Serving as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.&lt;ref name=Wonderlic1983&gt;{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F. Wonderlic &amp; Associates, INC|location=Northfield, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each profession has its own, unique, average; therefore, different professions require different standards.&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wonderlic1983"/&gt;

====Predictor of success in the NFL====
John P. Lopez of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' proposed a 26–27–60 rule to predict a quarterback's success in the NFL (at least a 26 on the Wonderlic, at least 27 college starts, and at least 60% [[completion (American football)|pass completion]]) and listed several examples of successes and failures based on the rule.&lt;ref name="lopez20100708"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/john_lopez/07/08/qb.rule/index.html?xid=cnnbin&amp;hpt=Sbin |title=The Rule of 26–27–60 helps predict NFL quarterback success or failure |last=Lopez |first=John P. |date=July 8, 2010 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018000523/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/john_lopez/07/08/qb.rule/index.html?xid=cnnbin&amp;hpt=Sbin |archive-date=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study by McDonald Mirabile found that there is no significant correlation between a quarterback's Wonderlic score and a quarterback's passer rating, and no significant correlation between a quarterback's Wonderlic score and a quarterback's salary.&lt;ref name="mirabile2005"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/intelligence-and-football-testing-differentials-collegiate-quarterback-passing-performance-a | title=Intelligence and Football: Testing for Differentials in Collegiate Quarterback Passing Performance and NFL Compensation | publisher=United States Sports Academy | date=Spring 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 | last = Mirabile | first = McDonald P. | journal=The Sport Journal  | volume=8 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2009 study by Brian D. Lyons, Brian J. Hoffman, and John W. Michel found that Wonderlic scores failed to positively and significantly predict future NFL performance, draft position, or the number of games started for any position.&lt;ref name="lyons2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ledbetter20100306"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-falcons/nfls-success-using-wonderlic-352405.html |title=NFL's success using Wonderlic Test subject to interpretation |last=Ledbetter |first=D.

The Lyons study also found that the relationship between Wonderlic test scores and future NFL performance was negative for a few positions, indicating the higher a player scores on the Wonderlic test, the worse the player will perform in the NFL.&lt;ref name="lyons2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Not Much More than g?

I think they think guys who are intelligent will challenge authority too much".&lt;ref name="mcclellan20060615"/&gt; Mike Florio of [[Profootballtalk.com]] agreed with McInally:&lt;ref name="florio20110228"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/28/greg-mcelroy-gets-a-48-on-the-wonderlic/ | title=Greg McElroy gets a 48 on the Wonderlic | publisher=NBC Sports | work=Profootballtalk.com | date=February 28, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 | last=Florio | first = Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Scoring too high can be as much of a problem as scoring too low. Football coaches want to command the locker room. Being smarter than the individual players makes that easier. Having a guy in the locker room who may be smarter than every member of the coaching staff can be viewed as a problem&amp;nbsp;– or at a minimum as a threat to the egos of the men who hope to be able when necessary to outsmart the players, especially when trying in some way to manipulate them.}}

[[Job performance]] in the NFL also includes deviance. A 2016 study found that the Wonderlic significantly predicted future arrests — referred to as criminal off-duty deviance — [[National Football League player conduct controversy|in NFL draftees]].&lt;ref name="seifert20160412"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/201565 |title=Using data to predict arrest rates of NFL draft picks |last=Seifert |first=Kevin |date=2016-04-12 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{see also|List of NCAA Division I FBS football programs|List of NCAA Division I FCS football programs}}
The NFL consists of [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|thirty-two clubs]] divided into two conferences of sixteen teams each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs each.
The NFL season format consists of a four-week [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], a seventeen-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]], and a twelve-team [[NFL Playoffs|single-elimination playoff]] culminating in the [[Super Bowl]], the league's championship game.
College teams mostly play other similarly sized schools through the NCAA's divisional system. [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] generally consists of the major collegiate athletic powers with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships. [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] primarily consists of smaller public and private institutions that offer fewer scholarships than those in Division I. [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] institutions also field teams, but do not offer any scholarships.
Football teams in Division I are further divided into the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]] (consisting of the largest programs) and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Championship Subdivision]].
The Bowl Subdivision (FBS) previously did not have an organized tournament to determine its champion; instead, teams competed in post-season [[list of college bowl games|bowl games]].  Up through the 2013 season, the BCS National Championship game determined the national champion.  The game featured the #1 and #2 teams in the BCS rankings, a mixture of computer and human polls ranking the top teams in the country.  Beginning in the 2014 season, a 4-team playoff now determines the national champion.  The four teams competing in the [[College Football Playoff]] are decided by a 13-member selection committee using a complex set of selection criteria and each committee member valuing certain selection criteria differently. These criteria include Strength of Schedule, Conference Championships, Win-Loss Record, On-field play, non-conference schedule and much more.  The importance of traditional major bowl games will be preserved by using 2 of the 6 major bowls as the semi-finals of the playoff while the remaining 4 will incorporate traditional conference "tie-ins" to schedule teams in each bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/overview|title=Overview - College Football Playoff|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Championship Subdivision utilizes a college football playoff, the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]].  As of 2014, 24 teams are selected for the playoff.  Similar to the NCAA College Basketball Tournament, each conference champion received an automatic bid to the tournament.  The remaining tournament berths are awarded as "at-large" selections by a selection committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/interactive-bracket/football/fcs|title=2016 FCS Championship Bracket|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago===
In [[2002 Chicago Bears season|2002]], the [[Soldier Field]] was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, a day after the Bears lost in the [[2001–02 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. It reopened on September 27, 2003 after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).&lt;ref name="Wrigley Field"&gt;{{cite web | title = Soldier Field History | work = BearsHistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx |accessdate = July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as "New Soldier Field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soldier Field History |work=ChicagoBears.com |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |accessdate=July 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205064756/http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |archivedate=December 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the {{nfly|2002}} season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], where they went 3–5.

===Cleveland===
[[Cleveland Stadium]] hosted the annual [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]/[[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] college football game 11 times: in 1932, 1934, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1947, 1950, 1952, 1976 and 1978. The games were well attended, with an average attendance of 69,730 and a high of 84,090 fans for the 1947 game, which was won by Notre Dame 27-0. The only [[Great Lakes Bowl]] was held there in 1947. Local colleges [[Case Institute of Technology]] and [[Western Reserve University]] used the field from time to time as well. The [[Illinois Fighting Illini]] played the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]] there in 1959. The [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] played in the stadium four times. The first was in a 1942 win over Illinois before 68,656, the second a 1943 loss to Purdue, and the third a 1944 victory over Illinois. The final college football contest played there was on October 19, 1991, when the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] played a "home" game against the Buckeyes. While Northwestern received the home team's share of the gate receipts, the crowd was mostly Ohio State fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toman|first=James A.|title=Cleveland Stadium: Sixty Years of Memories|year=1994|publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Press, Inc.|location=Cleveland, Ohio|isbn=0-936760-09-5|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ohio Classic]] [[college football]] game was held at [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|FirstEnergy Stadium]] in both 2004 and 2005.

===Detroit===
In college sports, Detroit's central location within the Mid-American Conference has made it a frequent site for the league's championship events. While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to [[Cleveland]] starting in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field in Detroit since 2004, and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans. The [[University of Detroit Mercy]] has a  [[NCAA Division I]] program, and [[Wayne State University]] has both NCAA Division I and [[NCAA Division II|II]] programs. The NCAA football [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]] is held at Ford Field each December.

===Green Bay===
When built, [[Lambeau Field]] was also slated to be used by Green Bay's public high schools, as old City Stadium had been. However, a key [[1962 NFL season|1962]] game between the [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] and [[1962 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] was affected when two high schools played in the rain the preceding Friday, damaging the field. After that, Lombardi asked the schools to avoid using Lambeau, however both Southwest High and West High played there until a high school stadium was built in the late 1970s. In 1970, Green Bay's Premontre High School (the alma mater of Lombardi's son, Vince Jr., which has since been merged into [[Notre Dame Academy (Green Bay, Wisconsin)|Notre Dame Academy]]) hosted (and won) the state private school football championship.In 1982 and 1983, [[St. Norbert College]] hosted [[Fordham University]] (Lombardi's [[alma mater]]) in benefit games to fight cancer. Shortly after the 2006 Wisconsin–Ohio State hockey game, newspaper reports said the Wisconsin football team might be interested in moving a non-conference road game to Lambeau Field. In 2016, Lambeau Field will host the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin Badgers]] vs. [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] in the 2nd of a two-game series starting in 2014, where the game is in [[Houston]] at [[Reliant Stadium]].

===Jacksonville===
[[College sports]], especially [[college football]], are popular in Jacksonville. The city hosts the [[Florida–Georgia game]], an annual [[college football]] game between the [[University of Florida]] and the [[University of Georgia]], and the [[TaxSlayer Bowl]], a post-season college [[bowl game]]. Jacksonville's two universities compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]: the [[University of North Florida]] [[North Florida Ospreys|Ospreys]] and the [[Jacksonville University]] [[Jacksonville Dolphins|Dolphins]], both in the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UNF officially moves to Division I|first= Smits|last= Gary|newspaper= [[Jacksonville Business Journal]]|date=July 9, 2009 |url= http://jacksonville.com/sports/college/north_florida_ospreys/2009-07-09/story/unf_officially_moves_to_division_i|accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ju.edu/about.aspx |title=About JU |year=2010 |work=www.ju.edu |publisher=Jacksonville University |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112727/http://ju.edu/about.aspx |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City===
[[Arrowhead Stadium]] serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] five times. On the last weekend in October, the Fall Classic rivalry game between [[Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football|Northwest Missouri State University]] and [[Pittsburg State University]] takes place here. The Bearcats of Northwest and Gorillas of Pitt State are frequently ranked one-two in the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association|MIAA]] conference. In 2005, other games at Arrowhead included [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] playing host to [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]], and [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] hosting [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]].

===Los Angeles===
{{see also|History of the National Football League in Los Angeles}}
As of 2016, Los Angeles once again has an NFL team for the first time since the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]]; with the Rams returning from St Louis playing out of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum while [[SoFi Stadium]] is constructed at Inglewood. Prior to 1994 it had two teams simultaneously. Immediately after that season, the [[Los Angeles Rams (1946–94)|Los Angeles Rams]] moved from suburban Anaheim to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] returned to [[Oakland, California]]. The following year, the San Diego Chargers announced that they would return to Los Angeles, again giving it two teams.

Los Angeles had multiple teams in the multiple [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]], prior to the NFL. The [[Los Angeles Wildcats]], also called "Wilson Wildcats", were a traveling team for the first AFL in 1926. The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were members of AFL  (1937) and a minor AFL (1939) before joining the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]]. The Los Angeles Chargers were a charter member of AFL in 1960, becoming the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1961. They returned to Los Angeles in 2017.

The Los Angeles area has hosted the [[Super Bowl]] seven times. The [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] hosted [[Super Bowl I]] in 1967 and [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973. The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] hosted [[Super Bowl XI]] in 1977, [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980, [[Super Bowl XVII]] in 1983, [[Super Bowl XXI]] in 1987 and [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in 1993. The city ranks third on the list of having hosted the most number of Super Bowls, after [[Miami]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{see also|UCLA–USC rivalry}}
The metropolitan area boasts nine [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletic programs. The best-known are the two whose [[college football|football]] teams compete in the top-level [[Football Bowl Subdivision]], both of which are in the city of Los Angeles proper:

* [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]]&amp;nbsp;– Winners of more national team championships than any other college program (105), and 259 individual national championships (364 total national championships).
* [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]]&amp;nbsp;– Winners of 91 national team championships, and 357 individual national championships (448 total national championships).

USC has 11 national championships in football and, together with Notre Dame, has more Heisman Trophy winners than any other school.

===New York City===
The [[New York Jets]] of the [[American Football League]] and later, the [[National Football League]] played at Shea for twenty seasons, from 1964 to 1983 (excluding their first home game in 1977 played at [[Giants Stadium]]). The stadium hosted three Jets playoff games: the [[American Football League]] Championship in 1968 (beat the [[Oakland Raiders]], 27–23), an AFL Divisional Playoff in 1969 (lost 13–6 to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]) and the 1981 AFC Wild Card Playoff game (lost 31–27 to the [[Buffalo Bills]]). For most of the Jets' tenure at Shea, they were burdened by onerous lease terms imposed at the insistence of the Mets.  Until 1978, the Jets could not play their first home game until the Mets' season was finished. For instance, in [[1969 New York Jets season|1969]], the defending Super Bowl champion Jets didn't play a home game until October 20 due to the Mets advancing to (and winning) the World Series.  Even after 1978, the Mets' status as Shea's primary tenants would require the Jets to go on long road trips (switching Shea from baseball to football configuration was a rather complex process, involving electrical, plumbing, field and other similar work). The stadium was also not well maintained in the 1970s. The Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] for the 1984 season, enticed by the additional 15,000+ seats offered there. Fans ripped Shea apart after the last game of the 1983 season, which also was the last NFL appearance for [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]], who threw two touchdown passes to lead the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to a 34–7 victory.&lt;ref name="nyt-1983-12-11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unruly Fans Mar Shea Farewell As Jets Lose, 34–7 |first=Gerald |last=Eskenazi |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/sports/unruly-fans-mar-shea-farewell-as-jets-lose-34-7.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 11, 1983 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the scoreboard operator had a field day, displaying the home team as the "N.J.

Simpson]] became the first running back to gain 2,000 yards in a single season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson Breaks Mark as Bills Rout Jets |first=Murray |last=Chass |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB081FFE3B59147A93C5A81789D95F478785F9 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 1973 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and, to date, the only player to do it in 14 games or fewer). In the 1983 season, a Jets game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] featured an 85-yard touchdown run by rookie [[Eric Dickerson]], as well as a brawl between Rams offensive tackle [[Jackie Slater]] and Jets defensive end [[Mark Gastineau]] when Slater blindsided Gastineau after the Jet performed his infamous "Sack Dance" over fallen Rams quarterback [[Vince Ferragamo]]. The [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]] played their 1975 season at Shea while [[Giants Stadium]] was being built. The Giants were 5–9 that year (2–5 at Shea). Their coach was [[Bill Arnsparger]] and their quarterback was [[Craig Morton]]. The football field at Shea extended from around home plate all the way to the outfield, with the baseline seating rotating out to fill left and right fields.

The first [[college football]] game played in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] was a 3-0 [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] victory over [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] on October 20, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/ys.htm|title=Football Games at Yankee Stadium|publisher=Lucky's Amazing Sports Lists|date=December 29, 2012|accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an ill Ruth could not lead the Yankees to the World Series in 1925, college football took center stage at Yankee Stadium that fall. The fiercely competitive [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]–[[Army Black Knights football|Army]] game moved to Yankee Stadium, where it remained until 1947. In the 1928 game, with the score 0–0 at halftime, legendary Notre Dame coach [[Knute Rockne]] gave his "win one for the Gipper" speech (with reference to All-American halfback [[George Gipp]], who died in 1920); Notre Dame went on to defeat Army, 12–6. The 1929 game between the two teams had the highest attendance in the series at 79,408.&lt;ref&gt;Notre Dame football media guide (PDF copy available at [http://und.cstv.com und.cstv.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226023556/http://und.cstv.com/ |date=2009-02-26 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game]] at Yankee stadium is regarded as one of the 20th century college football [[Game of the Century (college football)|Games of the Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittingham |first=Richard |editor= |others= |title=Rites of autumn: the story of college football |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year= 2001 |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-2219-9 |oclc= |id= |pages=148–183 |chapter=6 |chapterurl= |quote=It was surely the game of the year, and many have said it was the college football game of the century }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Notre Dame played 24 games at Yankee Stadium, going 15–6–3. Army played 38, compiling a 17–17–4 record (including the best-attended game, on December 1, 1928 when Army lost to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] 26–0 before 86,000 fans). [[New York University]] played more games there than any other school, 96, using it as a secondary home field from 1923 to 1948, with a record of 52–40–4. Nearby [[Fordham University]] played 19 games there, going 13–5–1. Eight college football games were played at Yankee Stadium on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], the first seven by [[New York University]].  Perhaps, the most famous Thanksgiving Day game was the first.  Oregon State Agricultural College (now [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]]) was the first West Coast team to travel across the country and play an East Coast team.  8–1 NYU was a 3–1 favorite to beat 5–3 OSAC, but Oregon State upset the hometown favorites 25–13. Will Rogers lamented what the "Oregon apple knockers" had done to his "city slickers" in a column after the game.  After the 1928 game, NYU beat Carnegie Tech (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) in 1931 and 1932, defeated Fordham in 1936, lost to Carnegie Tech in 1929, and lost to Fordham in 1934 and 1935.  In the eighth game, in 1963, Syracuse beat Notre Dame, 14–7. This was a rematch following the teams' controversial 1961 game won by Notre Dame, 17–15. The [[Gotham Bowl]] was scheduled to premiere at Yankee Stadium in 1960, but was canceled when no opponent could be found for [[Oregon State University]]. The 1961 game was moved to the [[Polo Grounds]], and when just 6,166 people came to Yankee Stadium for the 1962 game, in which the [[University of Nebraska]] defeated the [[University of Miami]], 36–34, the Gotham Bowl was never played again. The Miami-Nebraska game remains the only college bowl ever played at the stadium. In 1969, Notre Dame and Army reprised their long series at the Stadium (1925–1946 except 1930) with one final game. Starting in 1971, the Stadium hosted the [[Whitney M. Young]] [[Urban League]] Classic, a game between [[historically black college]]s, often featuring [[Grambling State University]] of [[Louisiana]], coached by [[Eddie Robinson (football coach)|Eddie Robinson]], the first college coach to win 400 games. The Classic helped to spread the fame of Grambling and other similar schools. Yankee Stadium hosted its final Classic during the 1987 season, also the last time a football game was played there. Grambling lost to [[Central State University]] of Ohio, 37–21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~luckyshow/football/ys.htm|title=redirect|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329071309/http://www.mindspring.com/~luckyshow/football/ys.htm|archive-date=29 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classic has been held at [[Giants Stadium]] and [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]]'s [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] ever since, though the Yankees remain a supporter of the event. In 1926, after negotiations failed with the fledgling NFL and the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Red Grange]] and his agent C.C. Pyle formed the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]] and fielded a team called the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] based in Yankee Stadium. The league failed after only one year, but the team continued as a member of the NFL for two seasons before ceasing operations. A [[New York Yankees (1936 AFL)|second New York Yankees]] football team, not related to the first, split its home games between Yankee Stadium and [[Downing Stadium]] as it competed in the [[American Football League (1936)|second AFL]] in 1936 and 1937. A [[American Football League (1940)|third AFL]] [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|New York Yankees]] took the field in 1940 and became the New York Americans in 1941. The [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) played their home games at Yankee Stadium from 1946 to 1949. Following the [[1949 NFL season|1949 season]], the NFL [[New York Bulldogs]] acquired many of the players from the 1949 Yankees.  Using the name the [[New York Yanks]] they played two seasons at Yankee Stadium, [[1950 NFL season|1950]] and [[1951 NFL season|1951]]. The [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] played their home games at Yankee Stadium from [[1956 NFL season|1956]] to [[1973 NFL season|1973]]. On December 28, 1958, Yankee Stadium hosted the NFL championship game, frequently called "[[1958 NFL Championship Game|The Greatest Game Ever Played]]". The [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] tied the [[1958 New York Giants season|Giants]], 17–17, on a field goal with seven seconds left. Led by quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]], the Colts won in overtime, 23–17. The game's dramatic ending is often cited as elevating professional football to one of the United States' major sports.  Additionally, one of the most notable plays in NFL history occurred at Yankee Stadium on November 20, 1960 when the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Chuck Bednarik]] forcefully tackled the Giants' [[Frank Gifford]] in the last minute of a close game, forcing a fumble recovered by the Eagles that clinched the victory for Philadelphia and ultimately helped the Eagles dethrone the two-time defending champion Giants as NFL Eastern Division champions. The hit left Gifford with a concussion and forced his temporary retirement from football for the remainder of the [[1960 NFL season|1960 season]] and all of the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Are They Now: C/LB Chuck Bednarik|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story-WhereAreTheyNow.asp?story_id=15075|publisher=PhiladelphiaEagles.com|accessdate=2011-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311014450/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story-WhereAreTheyNow.asp?story_id=15075|archive-date=2009-03-11|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants played their first two home games at Yankee Stadium in [[1973 NFL season|1973]], concluding their tenancy on September 23 with a 23–23 tie against the [[1973 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. In October, they moved to the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for the rest of the season.

===Phoenix===
The [[Arizona Cardinals]] moved to Phoenix from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1988 and currently play in the [[NFC West|Western Division]] of the [[National Football League]]'s [[National Football Conference]]. The team, however, has never played in the city itself; they played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe until 2006. Sun Devil Stadium held [[Super Bowl XXX]] in 1996 when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The Cardinals now play at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in west suburban Glendale. University of Phoenix Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008, in which the [[New York Giants]] defeated the [[New England Patriots]]. It is also the home of the annual [[Fiesta Bowl|Tostitos Fiesta Bowl]], a college football bowl game that is part of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS). The University of Phoenix Stadium will host [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015.

===San Francisco Bay Area===
All three football-playing schools in the Bay Area are in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]], the highest level of NCAA [[college football]]. The [[California Golden Bears]] and [[Stanford Cardinal]] compete in the [[Pac-12 Conference]], and the [[San Jose State Spartans]] compete in the [[Mountain West Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themwc.com/genrel/050412aag.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105000238/http://www.themwc.com/genrel/050412aag.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-05 |title=San José State, Utah State to Join Mountain West – Mountain West Conference Official Athletic Site |publisher=Themwc.com |accessdate=2012-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal and Golden Bears are intense rivals, with their football teams competing annually in the [[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]] for the Stanford Axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/sports/college/football&amp;id=8433343 |title=Cal, Stanford get pumped up for The Big Game &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730102856/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Fsports%2Fcollege%2Ffootball&amp;id=8433343 |archive-date=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous games in the rivalry is the 1982 edition, when the [[California Golden Bears football|Golden Bears]] defeated the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Cardinal]] on a last-second return kickoff known as "[[The Play (Stanford vs. California)|The Play]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://california.scout.com/2/814436.html |title=Scout.com: The Big Game: Cal vs. Stanford |publisher=California.scout.com |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2012-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525002822/http://www.scout.com/college/california/story/814436-the-big-game-cal-vs-stanford?s=166 |archive-date=2017-05-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Louis===
[[Saint Louis Billikens|Saint Louis University]] (SLU) plays [[NCAA Division I]] sports as a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. SLU dropped football as an intercollegiate sport in 1949, but SLU is best known for its [[Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball|men's basketball]] and [[Saint Louis Billikens men's soccer|men's socce]]r programs. The [[Edward Jones Dome]] hosted the first [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Conference football championship game]] in 1996 ([[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]] versus [[University of Texas-Austin|Texas]]). The third game, in 1998, was also held in the dome ([[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] versus [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]]). The dome has also been a neutral site for regular-season college football matchups between the [[University of Illinois]] and the [[University of Missouri]], promoted locally as the "[[Arch Rivalry]]". Missouri has won all six games (2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010).

===Washington, DC===
On December 20, 2008, Washington hosted its first college bowl game, the [[Military Bowl|EagleBank Bowl]], at RFK Stadium. The [[2008 EagleBank Bowl|first match-up]] saw [[2008 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]] defeat [[2008 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]], 29&amp;ndash;19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Washington Post |title=A D.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5231">'''National Football League Properties''' also known as '''NFL Properties''' (abbreviated '''NFLP''') is the merchandising and licensing arm of the [[National Football League]]. The subsidiary of the league was founded in 1963 to maintain control of the brands of the league and its franchises and to license and negotiate with vendors to create official NFL merchandise. The NFL Properties head office is located in [[New York City]].

==Team NFL Heroes "mascot" program==
A line of [[mascot]]-like characters representing each team in the NFL was developed by NFL Properties in the early 1990s. Named "Team NFL Heroes", various types of merchandise such as stuffed dolls, school supplies, t-shirts, and lamps featuring the characters were manufactured and marketed mainly to children and teenagers. Mascot costumes of each character were created and people wearing these costumes made an appearance at the [[1994 NFL season|1995]] [[Pro Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bizarre-nfl-mascots-from-1995-2013-12#/#the-atlanta-falcons-mascot-had-an-absurdly-long-neck-1&lt;/ref&gt; ([https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bizarre-nfl-mascots-from-1995-2013-12#/#the-atlanta-falcons-mascot-had-an-absurdly-long-neck-1 Pictures of the costumes at the game can be seen online.])  Most of the Team NFL Heroes characters only lasted a season or two but a handful ended up being adopted as official mascots by their respective teams, either immediately after the Team NFL Heroes project was canceled or years later; Revere, the [[New England Patriots]] Team NFL Hero (name later changed to [[Pat Patriot]] after becoming the team's live mascot), is an example of the former while [[Miles (mascot)|Miles]] the [[Denver Broncos]] Team NFL Hero is an example of the latter.

During the Team NFL Heroes campaign the [[Green Bay Packers]] had a [[bear]] for a mascot despite their arch rivals being the [[Chicago Bears]].  Specifically a [[polar bear]], the Packers' Team NFL Hero's name was "Bayer", a play on Green Bayer (meaning a citizen of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]) while simultaneously being a [[homonym]] of "bear".

==Comic books==
The NFL branched out into comic books in the early 1990s when [[Marvel Comics]] created the character [[NFL SuperPro]]. The comic book and character was widely panned and only 12 issues of the comic book were printed. The NFL also promoted SuperPro at some events by using a mascot.

==Video games==
Long before video games, The National Football League began licensing Electric Football in 1967. The Game was produced by Tudor Games. There have been several American football video games based on NFL teams created for various consoles and computers over the years, from [[NFL Pro League Football|NFL Pro League]] by Micro Sports Inc.  to [[10-Yard Fight]] and the [[Tecmo Bowl]] series for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] to the more well known [[Madden NFL series|Madden series]] that have been released annually since 1988. The Madden series is named after former coach and American football commentator [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]]. Prior to the 2005–2006 football season, other NFL games were produced by competing [[video game publisher]]s, such as [[2K Games]] and [[Midway Games]]. However, in December 2004, Electronic Arts signed a five-year exclusive agreement with the NFL, meaning only Electronic Arts will be permitted to publish games featuring NFL team and player names. This prompted video game developer [[Midway Games]] to release a game in 2005 called ''[[Blitz: The League]]'', with fictitious teams and players. In February 2008, [[EA Sports]] renewed their exclusivity agreement with the league through [[Super Bowl XLVII]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6185880.html |title=EA Sports extends NFL deal through 2012 season – Xbox 360 News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Sporting News]], as of October 2015 "it’s not publicly known when, or if, the contract will end."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/madden-nfl-16-ea-ssports-competition-nfl-2k-take-two-sports-video-games/w5q934xma88113pdihykd5ael&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/20/ea-has-exclusive-license-from-nfl-for-a-couple-more-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
NFL Properties was taken to court by former supplier American Needle, Inc over [[antitrust]] violations. The issue was NFL Properties granting exclusive license to one supplier over making a product.&lt;ref name="supcourt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court rules against NFL in merchandising antitrust case|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=May 24, 2010|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0524/Supreme-Court-rules-against-NFL-in-merchandising-antitrust-case|author=Warren Richey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court decisions varied on whether the league and it franchises were acting as a single entity, or whether franchises were competing with each other off the field in merchandising sales. The case was eventually appealed all the way to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="supcourt"/&gt;

NFL Players Inc. was formed in May 1994 as a way to find and create marketing opportunities for current and past NFL players, and also grant licenses to use players' names, numbers, likenesses, and images.&lt;ref name=SportsIllustrated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

In 1995, the [[National Football League Properties]] filed a [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against NFL Players Inc. and [[Coors Brewing Company]] as a result of a planned marketing campaign that labeled Coors Beer as "The Official Beer of NFL Players".&lt;ref name=Bernstein95/&gt;&lt;ref name=Promo/&gt; NFL Players Inc. countered that "NFL Players," was a natural abbreviation of their name, for which they owned the trademark.&lt;ref name=Bernstein95/&gt; Although the court ruled in favor of the NFL, Coors was still able to run the campaign after changing a few [[point of purchase]] materials.&lt;ref name=Promo&gt;{{cite news |title=Off the Team: NFL's infringement suit contends Coors is not a player. |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3XM9-3VX0-001S-80KW&amp;csi=158695&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Promo |date=September 1999 |accessdate=7 June 2013 |url-access=subscription |via=Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, NFL Players Inc. entered a licensing agreement with Nashville-based startup SchooloftheLegends.com (SOTL).&lt;ref name=Hieb&gt;{{cite news |title=Area startup inks deal with NFL players group |author=Dan Hieb |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2010/09/27/tidbits2.html |work=[[Nashville Business Journal]] |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOTL created a training videos site to connect players with their fans and provide online tips for members of the youth league.&lt;ref name=Hieb/&gt; The next year, NFL Players Inc. launched a licensing website with Playmark in order to create a simplified way for merchandise and software company's to acquire the rights of NFL players from NFL Players Inc.&lt;ref name=Kuriloff&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL Players to Launch Playmark Website for Licensing Images, Autographs |author=Aaron Kuriloff |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-24/nfl-players-to-launch-playmark-website-for-licensing-images-autographs.html |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;{{cite news |title=Seattle startup Playmark lands deal with NFL players |author=Gregg Lamm |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2011/10/playmark-lands-deal-with-nfl-players.html |work=[[Business Journals]] |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playmark, a Seattle-based start-up funded in part by NFL Players Inc., created the first sport-based software that allowed licensors to utilize an online process to secure the rights of players.&lt;ref name=Kuriloff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt; The One Team Shop, originally the NFLPA Shop, was launched by NFL Players Inc. as an e-commerce site in July 2012 to sell merchandise for current players.&lt;ref name=Dostal&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL Players Association launches e-commerce site |author=Erin Dostal |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=5647-5H51-JB46-20V3&amp;csi=355064&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=[[DMNews]] |date=July 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2013 |url-access=subscription |via=Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and media ==

NFL Players Inc. has also had a large role in creating events marketing NFL Players, including some on television and radio. In 1995, they were involved in the creation of the annual NFLPA Rookie Premiere, a multi-day event where new members of the league have their first trading card photo shoots, learn about their union and NFL Players Inc.'s initiatives, and are given advice on life as a rookie.&lt;ref name=Freifeld /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brockington/&gt; The Rookie Premiere gives the new players an opportunity to hear about specific issues such as financial and career planning, and the expectations for media and public appearances.&lt;ref name=Freifeld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Branch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brockington/&gt; Players are also given the opportunity to meet and interact with NFL Players Inc. partners and licensees, such as Pepsi, Nike, and trading card companies [[Topps]] and [[Panini Group|Panini]].&lt;ref name=Branch/&gt;

NFL Players Inc. started "Stay Cool in School" in 1997.

The '''NFL Color Rush''' was a promotion done in conjunction with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] that promotes so-called "color vs. color" matchups with teams in matchup-specific uniforms that are primarily one solid color with alternating colored accents, primarily airing on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''. Despite being promoted as color vs. color, some games had one team wearing traditional white uniforms, either by choice or out of necessity. The uniforms did not count against each team with regards to their allowed [[Third jersey|alternate uniform]] allotment. The games received mixed responses from fans, with some praising the NFL for changing up their games in terms of uniforms, while others criticized the promotion for some of its garish uniforms. The promotion was officially discontinued for the [[2018 NFL season]], but many teams continue to wear the Color Rush uniforms and promote them heavily, notably the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

==History of color vs. color matchups==

===Early years===
In the early days of the NFL up through [[World War II]], it was not uncommon to see teams wearing their team colored uniforms against each other, often only wearing a second jersey if the uniforms were too similar. Following the arrival of the rival [[All-America Football Conference]] where each team had both a team colored jersey and a white jersey, NFL teams began adding a white jersey as a neutral color to avoid color clashes. Again, this was only used if teams such as the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]] (the latter before the arrival of [[Vince Lombardi]]) played each other and had similar jersey colors. Additionally, NFL teams were not required to add a white jersey.

It would not be the AAFC (which partially merged into the NFL in 1950) that would change the status quo, but the mainstream adoption of television. Due to the technical limitations of TV, programming could only be broadcast in black and white, making it hard for fans to tell their teams apart. Out of necessity, starting with the [[1957 NFL season]], all teams were required to have both a team colored jersey and a white jersey, with the team colored jerseys being worn at home and white jerseys being worn at away games. This caused teams such as the Chicago Bears, [[Detroit Lions]], Green Bay Packers, and [[Los Angeles Rams]] (none of which had a white jersey for the [[1956 NFL season|1956 season]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/1956.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;) to add a contrasting white jersey. In the Rams' case, it also forced the team to drop their gold jersey, as it was considered "too light" to wear against teams wearing white jerseys, replaced by blue jerseys. Other teams, such as the [[Cleveland Browns]], that had worn white as their primary home uniform were also no longer allowed to wear those jerseys at home.

For the [[1964 NFL season]], the league allowed the home team to decide which jersey could be worn at home, which prompted many teams to wear their white jerseys at home so that fans could see the colors of the visiting team. With [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout]] policies not allowing the home games to be aired in home markets until [[1973 NFL season|1973]], this also meant that fans not attending games in person at times only saw the team's darker colored uniform on TV, which depending on the television they were watching may still be in black and white. Despite this rule change and the widespread adoption of [[color television]] by the end of the 1960s, the color/white rule generally remains in effect for the NFL even as [[college football]] relaxed its jersey rules in 2009.&lt;ref name="Rule change"&gt;{{cite web |title=NCAA changing rules to accommodate USC-UCLA jersey tradition |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/02/ncaa-changing-r.html |date=19 February 2009 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaguewide promotions===
The NFL began to allow exceptions as part of leaguewide promotions, beginning with the league's 75th Anniversary season in [[1994 NFL season|1994]]. For the first time, the NFL allowed teams to wear [[throwback uniform]]s and in some cases allowed color vs. color as long as the colors did not clash with each other.

Color vs. color matchups would continue for a time in the early 2000s, mostly on [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] games. In [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the league allowed alternate uniforms with some jerseys being allowed to be worn against a colored jersey if it was light enough. Examples included gray jerseys worn by the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the present day, as well as a one-off gold alternate by the [[New Orleans Saints]] that was worn against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in 2002.

In [[2009 NFL season|2009]], the NFL celebrated what would have been the 50th season of the [[American Football League]] by allowing each of the original eight AFL teams to wear AFL-era throwback uniforms. One of those teams, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], was granted special permission by the NFL to allow the visiting [[Dallas Cowboys]] to wear their early 1960s throwbacks against the Chiefs (wearing throwbacks of their predecessors, the Dallas Texans) in "The Game that Never Was". 2009 was also the year of the [[digital television transition in the United States]], which rendered the remaining black-and-white television sets in the United States fully obsolete.

==Launching the Color Rush==

===Initial rollout===
For the [[2012 NFL season]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] replaced [[Reebok]] as the league's uniform supplier. As Nike had been the longtime supplier of the [[Oregon Ducks football]] team and used the Ducks as the team to start the trend of college football teams radically changing their uniforms on a regular basis, some had speculated that the NFL was about to follow college football's path, or at the very least one team becoming the "Oregon of the NFL". The [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Miami Dolphins]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[New York Jets]] are the only teams that completely redesigned their uniform since Nike took over, but none of them became the "Oregon of the NFL", with the Browns, Dolphins, and Vikings opting for more traditional styles. This was further subdued in [[2013 NFL season|2013]] when the NFL banned alternate helmets out of fears of [[Concussions in American football|concussions]].

During the Packers [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.|annual]] [[shareholder]] meeting in 2015, the team nonchalantly mentioned that color vs. color matchups would be allowed as an option during ''Thursday Night Football'' contests in [[2015 NFL season|2015]], while becoming mandatory in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/packers-unveil-retro-uniforms-to-be-worn-vs-chargers-b99546033z1-319137191.html|title=Packers unveil retro uniforms to be worn vs. Chargers|last=Silverstein|first=Tom|publisher=Journal Sentinel, Inc.|date=28 July 2015|website=jsonline.com|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this belief thought teams would be allowed to wear their normal uniforms against each other or even their alternates. However, in a surprise, on October 30, 2015, the NFL announced the initial "Color Rush," a series of four Thursday contests in which all eight teams will wear specially designed alternate uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NFL and Nike Flood Thursday Night Football with Color|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-and-Nike-Flood-Thursday-Night-Football-with-Color.aspx|publisher=National Football League|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kania |first=Joe |url=http://www.buccaneers.com/news/article-1/Splash-of-Color-for-Thursday-Night-Teams/a49ec3b0-d3bc-4f95-8881-7b7fd1216685 |title=Splash of Color for Thursday Night Teams |website=Buccaneers.com |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial run===
The initial rollout featured the [[Carolina Panthers]] and [[Tennessee Titans]] wearing their regular alternate uniforms (with the Panthers debuting "Carolina blue" pants), while the Dallas Cowboys revived their white "Double Star" uniforms from the mid-1990s (while debuting white pants) and the then-St. Louis Rams wore a yellow version of their 1973–99 throwbacks for the games. The other four teams involved wore all-new uniforms for the games:

*The [[Buffalo Bills]] debuted all-red uniforms for the first time in team history, with red, white and blue shoulder stripes and blue-white-blue pants stripes. (In a minor inconsistency, the team's blue "charging buffalo" helmet logo was used, instead of the all-red "standing buffalo" the team uses on their throwback uniforms.)
*The Jacksonville Jaguars wore all-gold uniforms, after an accent color on their uniforms.
*The [[New York Jets]], who wore kelly green from 1963–1997, wore their current uniforms in the kelly green color scheme, with their normally white sleeves also green and the middle shoulder stripe being the team's current shade of hunter green.
*The Tampa Bay Buccaneers wore an all-red ensemble.

===Full rollout===
For the [[2016 NFL season]], it was expected that all 32 teams would now participate, with some teams eager to unveil their Color Rush uniforms. The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]—one of the league's more conservative and tradition-bound teams with regards to uniforms—were the only team that did not participate in the 2015 Color Rush that revealed their Color Rush uniform style (but not revealing their uniform itself) before the leaguewide unveil, confirming that it wear all-black uniforms with gold numbers on Christmas Day against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title='Color rush' uniforms revealed|url=http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Color-rush-uniforms-revealed/7923a80f-03a1-4058-aa7d-6d014fce45d8|website=steelers.com|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC.|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team had planned on wearing a Color Rush uniform for its only ''Thursday Night'' match up against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], but opted for the home game on Christmas against its hated rival and will wear their standard road uniforms against the Colts. It was later announced that Thanksgiving games were exempt from the Color Rush promotion.

On September 13, 2016, the NFL and Nike unveiled the Color Rush uniforms for all 32 teams. The eight teams that participated in the Color Rush the year before will continue their uniforms while the Steelers had already announced theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NIKE AND NFL LIGHT UP THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL|url=http://news.nike.com/news/nfl-color-rush-uniform-2016|publisher=Nike, Inc.|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NFL &amp; Nike Light Up ''Thursday Night Football''|url=https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-and-Nike-Light-Up-Thursday-Night-Football.aspx|publisher=National Football League|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2016, the Jets, Browns, and Rams will wear their regular white uniforms (see below), while the Cardinals, Falcons, and Texans will also wear their regular white uniforms due to their opponents wearing similar Color Rush uniforms and their opponents being the home team. The Lions, Colts, and Redskins will not wear their Color Rush uniforms at all for 2016 due to Thanksgiving games being exempt and none of the three teams having other Thursday night games or (in the Steelers case) [[National Football League Christmas games|playing on Christmas Day]].&lt;ref name="colorblind" /&gt; The 2017 season also featured at least one team, the Buffalo Bills, wearing their Color Rush uniform on a Sunday afternoon game (coincidentally [[Snow Bowl (2017)|this game]] occurred during a [[Lake-effect snow|lake-effect snowstorm]] which made the Bills players more visible than their opponents, the all-white wearing [[Indianapolis Colts]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20180112024355/http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/Bills-announce-teams-Family-Day-sponsored-by-Independent-Health--Fan-Appreciation-Day-/52a03b63-4ea5-479c-a77a-1ce82c44d49f Bills announce team's Family Day sponsored by Independent Health &amp; Fan Appreciation Day], ''buffalobills.com'' (December 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2017 Pro Bowl]] also features the two conference all-star teams in solid red and blue colors respectively.

===Discontinuation===
On April 10, 2018, the league announced that Color Rush would be discontinued under the terms of the new ''Thursday Night Football'' broadcast contract. The exact terms of the discontinuation will be decided upon at the spring owners' meeting in May; tentative plans are for teams to be allowed to continue to use their existing Color Rush uniforms as standard third or fourth jerseys. Many teams during the 2018 season continued to wear their Color Rush uniforms during Thursday Nights, and the Browns, who were the last team to have worn their Color Rush uniform debuted theirs on September 20, 2018 in a 21-17 victory that was the Brown’s first win since the 2016 season. The Browns also debuted end zones painted with the stripe pattern found on their Color Rush jersey. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000925839/article/is-nfls-color-rush-era-in-danger-of-fading-away|title=Is NFL's Color Rush era in danger of fading away?|first=Austin|last=Knoblauch|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

===Jerseys and pants===
Uniforms are primarily one color, although the uniforms include different color accents for the jersey numbers and uniform details. Many uniforms duplicate the stripes and shoulder details of the team's current uniforms, but many do not. The Green Bay Packers' Color Rush Uniforms have the same stripe patterns on the sleeves as their regular uniforms, for instance. Conversely, the New England Patriots Color Rush uniforms mimic the stripes of their uniforms of a previous era. Whereas NFL teams most commonly wear pants in a contrasting color, all the Color Rush uniforms have pants and jerseys of the same color.

===Shoes and socks===
Color Rush uniforms also have matching colored shoes (instead of black or white) and matching socks.

===Helmets===
Most teams helmets do not change for the Color Rush games. The Denver Broncos, the New York Giants, and the Los Angeles Rams will wear helmets with versions of older logos affixed in 2016, while the New York Jets wore helmets with the same logo, but in a green chrome finish, in 2015, with the Cardinals doing the same to their helmets in 2016. Since NFL rules dictate that players wear the same helmet throughout the season, only the decals can change, and the shells remain the same color. As a result, although the Broncos Color Rush helmets resemble the ones from early history of the franchise, it is the same shade of blue as currently used.

===Opposing team whites===
If the Color Rush color is too similar to the home team, or if there are issues with visibility for color-blind viewers, the visiting team will wear their whites. It is unclear how each of these team will modify elements of their uniform for the Color Rush games, if at all. At least one team, the Arizona Cardinals, was given a choice between wearing their traditional white-on-white uniforms or a specially designed all-white uniform from Nike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-only-49ers-to-wear-color-rush-uniforms-for-thursday-night-football-vs-cardinals/|title=LOOK: Only 49ers to wear Color Rush uniforms for Thursday Night Football vs. Cardinals|last=Wilson|first=Ryan|date=October 5, 2016|website=CBS Sports|publisher=|access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals opted for their traditional whites, with white socks. In week two of 2016, the New York Jets wore white facemasks instead of green, white gloves, solid white socks instead of white with green stripes, and white shoes instead of their usual black in the spirit of the Color Rush program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/jets-alter-their-color-rush-jerseys-to-help-color-blind-viewers-091416 |title=Jets alter their 'Color Rush' jerseys to help color-blind viewers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In week three, the Houston Texans modified their uniforms by wearing solid white socks instead of their blue and white socks. In Week 15, the Rams wore their regular white uniform but switched the horns on the helmet from gold to white, marking the first time the team wore white horns on the helmet since the [[1972 Los Angeles Rams season|1972 season]]; this was also done as a nod to the [[Fearsome Foursome (American football)|Fearsome Foursome]]. The following year in 2017, the Rams decided to make the white horns a part of their regular uniforms, leaving most of their uniform intact save for the pants with the hope to rebrand completely in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/12/13/rams-to-wear-old-school-white-horns-on-thursday-night/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and controversy==
===Color blindness===
The first game [[Bills–Jets rivalry|between]] the Bills and Jets proved to be particularly problematic, with the Bills' all-red uniforms and the Jets' kelly green outfits being indistinguishable to those with [[color blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/color-blind-people-driven-nuts-watching-red-bills--green-jets-uniforms-021653681.html|last=Edholm|first=Eric|title=Color-blind people driven nuts watching red Bills, green Jets uniforms|work=Yahoo! Sports|date=12 November 2015|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other three games managed to avoid any controversy. The Bills and Jets would be matched against each other for three consecutive Color Rush games; for the second, the Jets wore all-white, while for the third, the Bills wore all-white, complete with white face masks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/page/QTP_17211JetsBillsRush/new-york-jets-buffalo-bills-pull-color-rush-uniforms-thursday-night-football&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, Nike brought in doctors from [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] to point out potential colorblindness issues. Aside from red-green, the NFL is also avoiding brown-purple (Browns/Ravens) and yellow-green (Rams/Seahawks) matchups, requiring one of those teams to wear white uniforms in those games.&lt;ref name="colorblind"&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17536350/nike-unveils-color-rush-uniforms-addresses-conflicts-colorblind&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team participation===
Some tradition-rich teams such as the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[New York Giants]] chose to wear an all-white ensemble instead of wearing an all-team color ensemble due to not wanting to mess with tradition, despite the Packers playing at home in their first Color Rush game and the team having a historical precedence with an all-green uniform in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17538646/uni-watch-goes-game-game-break-nfl-latest-color-rush-uniforms&lt;/ref&gt; (The Packers wearing white in the Color Rush game also marked the first time the team wore white in a home game since a two-game experiment at [[Lambeau Field]] in 1989, and only the second time in the team's 97-year history.) Giants co-owner [[John Mara]] said that Nike initially approached the team about doing an all-red ensemble (which Mara rejected out of hand) and later an all-blue ensemble (which Mara initially approved, but got [[cold feet]] at the last minute) before going with the all-white look as a nod to the [[Bill Parcells]] era of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://prosportsrundown.com/2016/12/22/the-hail-mary-hidden-story-new-york-giants-color-rush-uniforms/&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams that chose white as their Color Rush uniforms have either traditionally worn white (such as the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) or have already worn one-color ensembles as part of their regular uniforms on a regular basis, such as the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]]; in the latter's case, the team wore white uniforms as a nod to the [[white tiger]].&lt;ref name="Bengals" /&gt;

The Packers and Giants non-participation contrasted with another tradition-rich team, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], who fully embraced the Color Rush program and received a positive response from [[Steeler Nation|their fans]] over the all-black look.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.12up.com/posts/3775250-the-steelers-new-color-rush-jerseys-are-amazing&lt;/ref&gt; The Steelers plan to make their Color Rush uniform their official [[Third jersey|alternate uniform]] for 2017.&lt;ref name="Steelers"&gt;http://www.steelers.com/news/labriola-on/article-1/Labriola-on-bumblebees-switching-positions/e6a6dce9-cbe5-48c6-9feb-675e0cdcf268&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams such as the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Tennessee Titans]] went with their existing alternate uniforms for the Color Rush program, as opposed to creating a unique uniform for the games, while the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] simply matched their red jerseys up with their red pants—a look that the team had been sporting at times in recent seasons. The [[Chicago Bears]] simply wore their blue pants normally worn with their white jerseys with their blue jerseys, a look the team experimented with in the early 2000s.

In 2017, the [[Washington Redskins]] proposed a bylaw which would permit teams to opt out of Color Rush program participation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/All-15-NFL-Rule-Change-Proposals-For-2017/5643a94f-bf50-4373-a83d-21da56908b38&lt;/ref&gt; The Redskins later pulled the proposal before it went into a vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/report-redskins-pull-proposal-to-opt-out-of-color-rush-uniforms/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the official discontinuation of the Color Rush program in 2018, most teams continued to wear their Color Rush uniforms and even branded them as such, following a rule change that allows teams to wear alternate uniforms up to three times per season and allowed two alternate uniforms. The [[Cleveland Browns]], despite unveiling their Color Rush uniform in 2016, did not get the opportunity to wear theirs until the 2018 season, when it was met with great fanfare and subsequently worn two more times by the team that season. The [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[San Francisco 49ers]] dropped their Color Rush uniforms altogether by 2018 (the Jaguars due to an unrelated uniform redesign, while the latter two replaced their Color Rush designs with standard [[throwback uniform]]s), while the [[Tennessee Titans]] (who like the Jaguars also redesigned their uniforms for 2018) actually branding their official third uniform as their Color Rush uniform despite being introduced after the discontinuation of the program. Some teams like the Dallas Cowboys and [[Baltimore Ravens]] also began to incorporate their Color Rush pants into their regular uniform attire while keeping their Color Rush sets.

The '''London NFL franchise''' is a hypothetical [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[American football]] team based in London, England; formed as a new [[expansion team]], or by [[National Football League franchise moves and mergers|relocating]] one of the existing 32 NFL teams currently based in the United States. Should the league establish a team in London, it would become the first of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] to establish a franchise outside either of those two countries.

A London NFL franchise would be intended to grow the league's [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada#Revenues|revenues]] and provide further access to the British and [[Europe]]an markets. However, the [[Potential London NFL franchise#Mechanics|agreement of league owners]] is needed to undertake an expansion or relocation, and a London franchise would face [[Potential London NFL franchise#Issues|financial, legal and logistical challenges]]. Possible home stadiums for the London team include one or more of [[Wembley Stadium]], [[Twickenham Stadium]] or [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]].

The NFL is aiming to establish a London franchise by around 2025, and has the active support of the British government. Since 2007, the league has held multiple [[NFL regular season|regular season]] games in London each season as part of [[NFL International Series|NFL London Games]], allowing the league to test solutions to some of the challenges facing a hypothetical London franchise.

==Background==
Although [[American football in the United Kingdom]] has historically been a niche sport, British interest in the NFL peaked in the 1980s, in which time London hosted some [[American Bowl|pre-season games]]; during the 1990s, the city hosted the [[London Monarchs]] in the league's developmental [[NFL Europe|Europe League]].&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/10/02/nfl-team-in-london-international-series |title=Why London? And Can It Work? |date=October 2, 2014 |author=The MMQB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as all NFL Europe franchises outside Germany and the Netherlands, the Monarchs were ultimately relocated due to lack of public interest. Popular interest waned with the growth of the [[Premier League]] in the 1990s, although it grew again from 2007 following the establishment of the International Series. It also led to steady increases in actual participation in amateur games.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

==Mechanics==
An affirmative vote of three-quarters of the owners of the NFL's 32 clubs is required before a new team can be created (known as expansion) or before an existing team is allowed to move to a new market (known as relocation), i.e. 24 or more clubs would have to approve of the decision.&lt;ref name=NFLAP5May2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d828e3933/printable/vikings-in-limbo-and-expansion-not-on-nfls-radar |title=Vikings in limbo and expansion not on NFL's radar |date=May 5, 2012 |agency=Associated Press (via NFL.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters5January2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nfl-relocation-idUSKBN0UJ0A520160105 |title=Three NFL teams apply to move to Los Angeles area |date=January 5, 2016 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', as of 2015 it was "well-known" that a London franchise was a goal of the NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], although "he tends to avoid specifics on the process to make that happen".&lt;ref name=TheGuardian4August2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/04/how-close-are-we-to-a-london-jaguars-nfl-franchise |title=How close are we to a London Jaguars NFL franchise? |date=August 4, 2015 |author=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL's Executive Vice President International [[Mark Waller (American football executive)|Mark Waller]] is more specific, expressing the goal as "to build a fanbase that would be able to support a franchise".&lt;ref name=BusinessReporter2October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business-reporter.co.uk/2015/10/02/george-osborne-backs-drive-for-nfl-franchise-in-london/ |title=George Osborne backs drive for NFL franchise in London |date=October 2, 2015 |author=Business Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Atlanta Falcons]] owner [[Arthur Blank]] speaking in 2014, "The approach that the international committee and the commissioner have taken is, "Let's do London right, and then move from there to potentially somewhere else"."&lt;ref name=NBC2June2014/&gt;

===Expansion franchise===
In the opinion of former NFL executive [[Jim Bailey (American football)|Jim Bailey]], the NFL would probably prefer to create a London-based franchise through the expansion route, since that would offer them more control over the process.&lt;ref name=ESPN25September2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9716479/nfl-team-london-raises-legal-issues |title=NFL in London raises legal issues |date=September 25, 2013 |author=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CBS however, as of 2012 the club owners were generally satisfied with the league's 32 team model, and would prefer a relocation.&lt;ref name=CBS28October2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/jason-la-canfora/20724077/nfls-move-to-london-could-come-soon-jags-a-target |title=NFL's move to London could come soon; Jags a target |date=October 28, 2012 |author=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Associated Press, the 32 team model is seen as advantageous as it offers "competitively balanced schedules and division alignments".&lt;ref name=NFLAP5May2012/&gt; CBS also argued that expansion teams generally struggle "for quite some time", suggesting a relocated team would be the better option from the standpoint of competitiveness.&lt;ref name=CBS28October2012/&gt;

Speaking in 2012, Goodell responded positively to the prospect of creating new teams through expansion "in the foreseeable future".&lt;ref name=NFLAP5May2012/&gt; It has been speculated that the current (2012) US market was saturated, and so it was unlikely that an expansion team within the US would generate the NFL's desired growth without a fundamental change in their funding model, such as the introduction of pay-per-view TV, which was also seen as unlikely since the league's current broadcasting contracts run to 2022.&lt;ref name=NFLAP5May2012/&gt;

===Shared franchise===
According to NFL.com, one possible way to achieve a London franchise in a way that overcomes the various issues facing a London operation, which has been considered by team owners and NFL executives, is the possibility of a shared franchise, with the team playing four home games in London and four in the US, although this was not considered ideal as it could potentially weaken the appeal given the split fanbase and ultimately not achieve critical mass, in addition it would be unlikely to be attractive to London fans if it were assumed in that scenario that any such team would always play its post-season games in its US base. Speaking in 2015, Waller stated "we've never had real discussions about a shared market".&lt;ref name=NFL.com2October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000547487/article/london-team-by-2022-nfl-continues-to-forge-forward-in-uk |title=London team by 2022? NFL continues to forge forward in U.K. |date=October 2, 2015 |author=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocating a franchise===

====Jacksonville Jaguars====
As the designated home team for the International Series, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] are often mentioned as the most likely existing NFL team to relocate to London, leaving their current home of [[TIAA Bank Field]] in Florida.&lt;ref name=CBS28October2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph2January2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11322205/NFL-eye-Tottenhams-new-ground-as-home-for-London-based-American-Football-franchise.html |title=NFL eye Tottenham's new ground as home for London-based American Football franchise |date=January 2, 2015 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often pointed out in support that current Jaguars owner [[Shahid Khan]] is himself based in London, and also owns  [[Fulham F.C.]] While Khan admits the move has been a success in terms of improving the finances and profile of what was a small and struggling franchise, he has nonetheless been reluctant to commit to a move, preferring the current arrangement.&lt;ref name=BBCNews24October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/34622055 |title=NFL: Jacksonville Jaguars' Shahid Khan not sold on London move |date=October 24, 2015 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNews22October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/34597937 |title=NFL extends Wembley deal to play two games a year until 2020 |date=October 22, 2015 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2017, it was reported by [[City A.M.]] that the Jaguars are in discussion to build a permanent training facility near [[Wembley Stadium]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} If done, the team would be the first NFL franchise to have a training facility built outside of the U.S. On April 26, 2018 it was reported that Khan had made an offer to the [[The Football Association|FA]] to buy Wembley Stadium.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/26/fa-sell-wembley-fulham-owner-shahid-khan&lt;/ref&gt; although he subsequently rescinded that offer.

====Franchises with market knowledge====
As well as the Jacksonville Jaguars, the fact that some other existing franchises have owners with knowledge of the British market due to also owning United Kingdom based sports teams, such as the Glazer family's ownership of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] based in [[Tampa, Florida]] and [[Glazer ownership of Manchester United|Manchester United]] leads to them being suggested as potential relocation candidates. Up until their move to Los Angeles was announced in January 2016, this also included the former [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]] owned by  [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s majority shareholder, [[Stan Kroenke]].&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/29391069 |title=NFL Wembley: Seven years until London Jaguars? Rams? Raiders? |date=September 27, 2014 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Franchises with short leases====
The fact that the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] have a short term lease on its stadium is also often used to support media speculation that the franchise may be the one to relocate to London. This was also the case for the former [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] until their respective moves to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 (even so, although the Rams will own their stadium and are almost certain to stay in Los Angeles for the long-term, the Chargers will be leasing a stadium and have not yet established a fan base, leaving open the possibility for another relocation),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chargers-nfl-reportedly-considering-relocating-franchise-to-london-on-permanent-basis-amid-la-failures Chargers, NFL reportedly considering relocating franchise to London on permanent basis amid L.A. failures] by Will Brinson from CBS Sports, November 5, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oakland Raiders]] until [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocation to Las Vegas]] was approved in 2017.&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro14January2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/14/what-does-the-rams-move-to-la-from-st-louis-mean-for-londons-nfl-franchise-hopes-5621839/ |title=What does the Rams move to LA from St Louis mean for London's NFL franchise hopes? |date=January 14, 2016 |author=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most immediate likely candidate for relocation is the [[Carolina Panthers]]. The cost to terminate the Panthers' agreement to use [[Bank of America Stadium]] after the 2018 season is relatively small, and the team's incoming owner, [[David Tepper]], does not have any significant ties to the Carolinas and has been tepid in his support of keeping the team in the region, stating upon assuming ownership in July 2018 "Charlotte is a logical place (... but) you're asking me too much. The only thing I have a market on right now is a lack of knowledge. I'll call it stupidity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24049997/sale-panthers-david-tepper-finalized|title=Sale of Panthers to David Tepper finalized|last=Newton|first=David|date=9 July 2018|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the Raiders, the timing of the team's sale and stadium agreement is less than ideal, since the league does not intend to put a team in London on such short notice.

The Raiders, lacking a stadium for [[2019 Raiders season|2019]], were said to have an "extreme long shot" at playing all of their home games in London that year, should all other options fail. Cost and logistics concerns made this scenario unlikely, and the Raiders ultimately decided to renew their agreement with the [[Oakland Coliseum]] after initially stating they would not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/raiders-most-likely-to-play-in-bay-area-in-2019-at-the-stadium-of-either-49ers-or-giants/ Raiders most likely to play in Bay Area in 2019 at the stadium of either 49ers or Giants]. ''CBS Sports''. Retrieved January 12, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weaker franchises====
As happened with the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 2014, even franchises with relatively long lease agreements but which are otherwise seen as struggling in their own market, are often named by the media as potential candidates for relocation to London, on the basis that those advocating relocation to a more lucrative market would be offering more money than those proposing to stay put. In the specific case of the Bills, it was however suggested that the NFL would oppose relocation since they were the only NFL team which played in New York state (the New York Jets and New York Giants being located in a shared stadium in New Jersey).&lt;ref name=SBNation2June2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/6/2/5771714/buffalo-bills-sale-move-los-angeles-nfl |title=Buffalo Bills face potential move with upcoming sale |date=June 2, 2014 |author=SBNation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills' lease, which is effectively unbreakable in the short-term, has an exit window in 2019 and expires in 2022, coincidentally the same year as the NFL's target for a London franchise.

Countering one reason often cited as why the Jaguars would move, their low attendances, it has been argued that there are other franchises such as the Buccaneers with even lower attendances and less potential for growth in their own market in comparison.&lt;ref name=CBS5June2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/pete-prisco/22357404/why-not-london-bucs |title=Why not London Bucs? Don't assume Jaguars are moving |date=June 5, 2013 |author=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple franchises===
Given the size of London, it has even been suggested by [[Atlanta Falcons]] owner Arthur Blank that there could ultimately be more than one franchise located in London, although not before a team in another European country.&lt;ref name=NBC2June2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/02/arthur-blank-sees-maybe-more-than-one-nfl-team-in-london/ |title=Arthur Blank sees "maybe more than one" NFL team in London |date=June 2, 2014 |author=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential stadiums==
One potential advantage for London as a market for an NFL franchise is that all of the likely stadiums for the franchise have already been built, with two of them being built in the 21st century and having sufficient modern amenities to host such a team. This eliminates the expense, currently over one billion United States dollars, of constructing a stadium for the team that meets NFL specifications.

===Wembley Stadium===
[[Wembley Stadium]], England's national football (soccer) stadium, was rebuilt and re-opened in 2007, and was the first venue for International Series games in that same year. It was built with locker rooms which are twice the size usually found in soccer venues, which allows them to accommodate a 53-man NFL roster.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

Wembley is expected to remain the exclusive venue until at least the second game of the 2016 programme (October 23). The stadium's owners, the [[Football Association]], are reportedly interested in using Wembley as the base of a London team, but it has been suggested by ''The Telegraph'' that they may struggle to accommodate a full programme of NFL games, as well as hosting the [[England national football team]]. Another potential issue is the natural grass pitch (following the first International Series game, the pitch was upgraded to a partly artificial [[Desso]] surface&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;) – England team manager [[Roy Hodgson]] having previously complained about the state of the surface after just two International Series games,&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph2January2015/&gt; claiming one player injured his ankle in 2014 because of the cut-up pitch.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph6November2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/11214977/Roy-Hodgson-fears-NFL-game-will-spoil-Wembley-pitch-ahead-of-Euro-2016-qualifer-against-Slovenia.html |title=Roy Hodgson fears NFL game will spoil Wembley pitch ahead of Euro 2016 qualifer [sic] against Slovenia |date=November 6, 2014 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of NFL markings still being partly visible during soccer matches has also been criticised in the media.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph6November2014/&gt;

To test the implications of a full season at Wembley, the NFL scheduled two International Series games over two weekends, followed by an England soccer game, to see how the surface copes.&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014/&gt; Wembley earns an estimated £500,000 to £1 million per NFL game in profit;{{r|TheTelegraph2January2015}} due to the debt incurred in building it, the BBC commented that maximising the number of other events staged at Wembley is vital to the FA's financial health, believing the benefit of the consistent revenue stream of 8 NFL games a year would not escape their attention. Although mindful of the calendar, according to the stadium's managing director speaking in 2013, "Football [(soccer)] is our priority but yes, I'm absolutely confident that if Roger Goodell wanted to have a franchise here, we could absolutely deliver on it."&lt;ref name=BBCNews24September2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/24227296 |title=Why the NFL matters to Wembley Stadium's financial future |date=September 24, 2013 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible method of accommodating the full schedule of an NFL franchise that the FA is investigating (as of 2014), is playing some home England fixtures at other football stadiums around the country, something which had not been done since the stadium had been reopened. A 10-year restriction on having to play all home games at Wembley expired in 2017, although Wembley remains the regular home of the team.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian8October2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/08/england-hit-road-fa-wembley-nfl-franchise |title=England could hit the road as FA mulls idea of Wembley NFL franchise |date=October 8, 2014 |author=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting the idea, the BBC contrasted the low attendances of some England soccer friendlies at Wembley, which reached a record low of 40,181 in 2014, surpassing the previous record of 48,876 in 2011, with the 80,000 crowds for the 2014 three game International Series.&lt;ref name=BBCNews9October2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29546374 |title=England could play games around country if Wembley gets NFL team |date=October 9, 2014 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Jaguars owner [[Shahid Khan]] placed a bid on Wembley Stadium in an effort to solidify the Jaguars' presence in the city;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000928676/article/jaguars-owner-places-offer-to-buy-wembley-stadium|title=Jaguars owner places offer to buy Wembley Stadium|work=NFL.com|first=Kevin|last=Patra|date=April 26, 2018|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this offer was retracted in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45893325|title=Wembley: Shahid Khan withdraws 'divisive' offer to buy national stadium from FA|work=BBC News|date=October 18, 2018|accessdate=December 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tottenham Hotspur Stadium===
On July 8, 2015 it was announced that the NFL had agreed to stage a minimum of two games a season for a ten-year period at  [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium|Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium in Northumberland Park]], which opened nearly a year behind schedule in 2019. This was interpreted as boosting the chances of an eventual London franchise.&lt;ref name=BBCNews8July2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33442455 |title=Tottenham Hotspur will host NFL matches at new stadium |date=July 8, 2015 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider8July2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/nfl-tottenham-stadium-deal-london-nfl-team-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T |title=The NFL just got closer to putting a team in London |date=July 8, 2015 |author=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the deal, the stadium was specifically designed for both American and association versions of football. It has a retractable natural grass pitch over an artificial surface used for NFL games (which should allow both soccer and NFL games to be played on the same weekend&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider8July2015/&gt;), and with locker rooms of sufficient size to accommodate the 53-man size of an NFL team roster. Its proposed capacity of 61,000 was described a being more appropriate for the day-to-day requirements of an NFL franchise than Wembley's 84,000.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian4August2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider8July2015/&gt; It has been suggested the design will also eliminate the issue at Wembley whereby the lowest 5,000 seats cannot be used because spectator views of the pitch are obstructed by the various officials, coaches and players who stand on the sidelines during an NFL game.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph8July2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11725998/Tottenham-close-to-signing-deal-with-NFL-to-stage-American-Football-matches-at-new-61000-seater-stadium.html |title=Tottenham sign deal with NFL to stage American Football matches at new 61,000-seater stadium |date=July 8, 2015 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, [[Populous (company)|Populous]], had previously designed 14 NFL stadiums.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider8July2015/&gt;

===Twickenham Stadium===
On November 3, 2015, the NFL also announced it had reached a deal with the [[Rugby Football Union]] to host a minimum of three games in three years at [[Twickenham Stadium]], beginning from the 2016 International Series. The deal is designed to be flexible, i.e. it could involve two fixtures in one year and none the next.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph3November2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/11971890/Twickenham-agrees-deal-to-stage-NFL-games.html |title=Twickenham agrees deal to stage NFL games |date=November 3, 2015 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal also includes an option to add two more games in the same period.&lt;ref name=BBCNews3November2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/34707958 |title=NFL to play at Twickenham as three-year deal is announced |date=November 3, 2015 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-game commitment was fulfilled in two years. All three games were held in October, as the venue is home of the [[England national rugby union team|England national rugby team]] during the November test matches.

===Multiple stadiums===
To resolve some of the issues, it has also been suggested a London franchise may use more than one of the suggested venues as their home stadium.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph2January2015/&gt;

==Issues==
A number of issues need to be resolved before a London franchise can be set up; speaking in 2015 Waller stated "We feel very comfortable from a fan perspective, from a sponsor and a stadium perspective now, that we have all of the right things in place. The one thing that we’ve got to do more work on is how would it work from a team operational standpoint?"&lt;ref name=NBC25September2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/25/before-putting-an-nfl-team-in-london-league-wants-to-check-logistics/ |title=Before putting an NFL team in London, league wants to check logistics |date=September 25, 2015 |author=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logistics===
Speaking after talks with the UK government, [[Dan Marino]] argued that probably the biggest challenge facing a London franchise is the physical logistics of moving the staff and equipment across the Atlantic for every away game. To overcome this, he speculated that the NFL might follow the example of other sports like basketball and baseball, where some teams play away games in back to back series of three or four games, allowing the team to stay in the US for this part of their schedule.&lt;ref name=BusinessReporter2October2015/&gt; It has been noted that this approach may be problematic as it requires players to spend multiple weeks at a time away from home (whether home is in the US or London), something they would not have to do in a US based franchise. The NFL's use of a [[salary cap]] would also make using financial incentives to overcome this problematic.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian28September2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/28/london-nfl-franchise-work-sean-ingle |title=London looks increasingly likely to get NFL franchise but could it work? |date=September 28, 2014 |author=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2018 season, the league aims to test the concept of one of the teams playing back-to-back games in London.&lt;ref name="2022_target_doable"&gt;Breer, Albert (September 21, 2017). [https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/09/21/nfl-london-team-international-series-europe-football Game Plan: NFL Believes London is Ready for Team; 2022 Target is Doable]. ''SI.com''. Retrieved October 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-season and training camp===
As well as the issue of a home stadium facility, the league has also been considering where a London franchise would hold their [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]], which begins in late July and normally involves several players not yet formally signed to the club. Similarly, another issue is whether or not it would have a base in the US for the off-season period, the gap between whenever their season ends until the start of the following training camp, in which the club will normally hold several meetings regarding staff and player contracts.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

As of 2014 the NFL had investigated the possibility of a London team establishing a permanent base in conjunction with a Premier League  club, but it was considered unlikely for reasons of infrastructure and scheduling.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt; The league has also considered establishing a secondary base, probably in the [[Southeastern United States]], for the London club to use for circumstances when returning to London is impractical.&lt;ref name=2022_target_doable/&gt;

===Fanbase===
The NFL has set a target of reaching a total of 6 million "avid fans" in the UK before they will consider a London franchise viable, and surveys the UK annually to assess this figure;  an avid fan being defined by the NFL as someone who says they're "extremely interested" in the NFL or that it is their favourite sport. Speaking during the 2015 International Series, Waller stated "We’re currently at four million, we were at about 2.3  million when the International Series started [in 2007]. We’re on track to reach that six million target by 2020."&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph24October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/americanfootball/11953250/London-NFL-team-needs-two-million-extra-fans.html |title=London NFL team needs two million extra fans |date=October 24, 2015 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the start of 2016, he said "The fan base is big enough and passionate enough that it can support a franchise".&lt;ref name=BBCNews20January2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/35360989 |title=NFL plans permanent UK-based franchise 'in six years' |date=January 20, 2016 |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that a significant stumbling block to creating the necessary fanbase is ironically the success of the NFL in promoting itself in the UK in the past. Many fans had been drawn into the NFL when the game was popularized in the 1980s, leading to evidence of support for all of the NFL's 32 teams in UK based fans, many of whom would be unlikely to support a London team as a first resort, i.e. being unlikely to consider them anything other than their favorite second team at best, and a potential rival at worst. As a result, while wishing to retain the support of anyone for a London team on a second favorite basis, the NFL's UK operation has been focussing on growing the fan base by reaching out to younger fans without an established allegiance, and others who are entirely new to the sport.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian4August2015/&gt; The NFL's UK operation has pointed to the success of the 1995 expansion team the [[Carolina Panthers]] having grown a fanbase in a previously untapped market to support the idea that a London team could do the same.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

In an attempt to gauge support for a London team, from the 2015 season the dates and times of the International Series games were adjusted to make them more closely resemble the home fixtures of a London team, as opposed to casting them as one off special events being timed in a fashion more convenient for a US audience.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian4August2015/&gt;

As of the 2014 International Series, 9 out of 10 tickets for the games were bought by people who live within three hours' travel of London, with 33,000 people choosing to buy a package ticket for all three games.&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014/&gt; That number had risen to 40,000 repeat customers for the four-game package in 2017.&lt;ref name=2022_target_doable/&gt;

The league has been encouraged by the fact that the International Series games were still attracting over 80,000 fans for a game like the [[2015 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] versus the [[2015 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] on October 31, 2015, the teams which had the 24th and 31st best records in the NFL at game time, leading ''The Telegraph'' to observe that [[2015–16 Middlesbrough F.C. season|Middlesbrough]] vs [[2015–16 Brentford F.C. season|Brentford]] would be the equivalent English soccer fixture on the day (based on their positions in the [[2015–16 Football League Championship|Football League Championship]]).&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph31October2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/americanfootball/11967718/NFL-expansion-to-London-is-extraordinary-says-Leiweke.html |title=NFL expansion to London is 'extraordinary', says Leiweke |date=October 31, 2015 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===League schedule===
The NFL and others have also recognised that the current arrangement of giving all teams that play an International Series game the following week off (a bye-week) as being impractical if a London franchise was created, leading to the need to either change the schedule, or persuade teams to play UK and US fixtures in adjacent weeks.&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014/&gt; The arrangement practised by the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|University of Hawaii football team]], separated from the [[Continental United States|U.S. mainland]] by about 3,900&amp;nbsp;km/2,400 miles, has been suggested as the model to follow for playing blocks of two to three games, home and away.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

While still retaining the bye-week, as a test of the logistics, the first game of the 2015 International Series was the first time teams only travelled to London for the weekend, having previously spent a whole week in the UK.&lt;ref name=NFL.com2October2015/&gt;

===Competitiveness===
The NFL is mindful of avoiding the perception that any potential London franchise was being established simply to increase the profile and revenue of the league; any team based in London must be competitive and be able to win the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name=BBCNews27September2014/&gt;

The scheduling of the first back-to-back weekend fixtures in the 2015 International Series was also a test of a potential London franchise on competitiveness.&lt;ref name=NFL.com2October2015/&gt; One potential issue affecting competition that has been identified (by an NFL team owner) is what happens should a London franchise reach the post-season, which could possibly involve a long trip for a west coast based team to London, and then back to the US for the next weekend.&lt;ref name=NFL.com2October2015/&gt; In addition to the travel, it is believed this also presents a challenge in terms of potentially leaving away teams only a week to plan a foreign trip (in contrast to teams knowing the regular season schedule months in advance).&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

While the International Series fixtures have tested the effect on personnel of travelling east from the USA to the UK and then playing a game within a few days, because of the bye week it has yet to be established what the effect is when travelling the other way. It has been suggested this may be tested by scheduling one team to play back-to-back weekends in the International Series (as the notional home and away team).&lt;ref name=NFL.com2October2015/&gt;

Another issue considered is whether or not a London team would have an unfair competitive advantage compared to US-based teams, due to the extra distances away teams would have to travel to play them.&lt;ref name=TheMMQB2October2014/&gt;

===Tax===
As of 2013, players appearing in International Series games were subject to UK tax on their income and endorsements on a pro rata basis. If expanded to a full slate of regular season games, it has been suggested that unless the government granted exemptions to attract the NFL, which have been applied to some but not all sports/athletes, then the difference between the UK and US tax codes would be sufficient to dissuade players who are [[free agent]]s from signing for a London franchise.&lt;ref name=ESPN25September2013/&gt; The talks between the Chancellor and the NFL from 2014 onwards were interpreted by the media as a willingness to offer support in the form of promises of tax exemptions.&lt;ref name=TheTelegraph22October2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/americanfootball/11181223/London-based-NFL-team-receives-boost-with-Chancellor-confirming-he-has-held-talks-over-a-Wembley-franchise.html |title=London-based NFL team receives boost with Chancellor confirming he has held talks over a Wembley franchise |date=October 22, 2014 |author=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visas===
As of 2013, players appearing in International Series games were admitted on temporary working visas, a situation which would not be possible for players working a full home schedule, which would require visas to be issued by a UK government recognised governing body for the sport. Although the British version of the game is administered by the [[British American Football Association]] (BAFA), it is not recognised by the UK government for visa purposes. In order to clear these obstacles, it has been suggested the NFL would either have to create its own governing body in the UK, or work through BAFA after they gain approval. Although not expected to fail, it has been speculated that approval of the governing body could be conditional on restrictions being placed on the activities of the NFL in the UK that would not apply to US teams, depending on the government's view of how the visas benefit sport in the country. Analogies have been drawn to soccer, where players from outside the [[European Union]] must be shown to be bringing something "special and different", and teams are required to comprise a minimum number of EU citizens. Individual visas may still also be denied due to issues such as criminal convictions.&lt;ref name=ESPN25September2013/&gt;

===European Union law===
As a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), much of the UK's laws are based on EU law. It has been suggested that the NFL's use of a draft system and a minimum age limit on players would come into conflict with the EU's laws regarding [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|freedom of movement for workers]] and [[European Union competition law|competition]]. Citing sports lawyer Andrew Nixon, ESPN suggested in 2013 that while the draft may be permissible for the same reasons it is in the US, the age restriction had no US analogy, and so how it would be interpreted by the [[European Commission]] would be difficult to predict. The impact of the [[Bosman ruling]] on players contracts is also unclear. It also argued that while the UK government would have more interest in making adjustments to accommodate a London team, the EU as a whole would have less to gain by adjusting its laws. A suggested workaround of the team being based in the US and simply flying in for games, Nixon said this was "not something that has been done before and it is untested".&lt;ref name=ESPN25September2013/&gt;

On June 23, 2016, the UK [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|voted]] to [[Brexit|leave]] the EU. A spokesperson for the NFL said that it was working closely with its UK offices and "monitoring" the situation closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-monitoring-situation-united-kingdom-great-britain-brexit-vote-062416|title=NFL 'monitoring' UK situation after Brexit vote|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some speculation has led to keep NFL owners on alert if the UK goes into a [[recession]] following an exit from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/06/24/will-brexit-bench-nfl-nba-in-united-kingdom.html|title=Will Brexit Bench NFL, NBA In The United Kingdom?|first=Thomas|last=Barrabi|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective bargaining agreement===
Many aspects of NFL players' benefits and conditions are set down by the [[National Football League collective bargaining agreement]], negotiated by the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA), which could potentially impact the establishment of a London franchise.&lt;ref name=NBCSports2October2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/02/nflpa-believes-it-can-block-a-move-to-london/ |title=NFLPA believes it can block a move to London |date=October 2, 2013 |author=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheObserver27September2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/27/nfl-london-franchise-dallas-miami-oakland |title=London NFL franchise remains some way off, players’ union says |date=September 27, 2014 |author=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Last negotiated in 2011, the current version runs until the 2020 season.

Speaking in September 2014, George Atallah, the NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs, said of the issue that "A permanent team in London would require collective bargaining between the league and the players’ union and the NFL have not got to the point where they have said we want to raise it." and "Most players enjoy the experience of going over to London and from our perspective a team based in the UK could be viable – but only if the working conditions and health and safety aspects are satisfactory".&lt;ref name=TheObserver27September2014/&gt; This followed a 2013 comment that "Expanding to London by definition is a change in working conditions, placing the conversation squarely in the context of collective bargaining".&lt;ref name=ESPN25September2013/&gt;

NBC Sports has speculated that "It's possible that the NFLPA simply will never agree to a London move. If [they] realize that any of them could be traded to the London team, or could have a London-based team as their only option for ongoing NFL employment via free agency, keeping a team out of London would keep that from ever happening."&lt;ref name=NBCSports2October2013/&gt;

The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), currently contain 16 teams organized into 4 [[Division (sport)|divisions]]. Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]] with the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 clubs in each conference. The current AFC champions are the [[New England Patriots]], who defeated the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in the 2018 [[AFC Championship Game]] for their 11th conference championship.

==Current teams==
Since 2002, like the NFC, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into 4 [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]] and [[AFC West|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25549819/2019-nfl-pro-bowl-selections-all-32-teams-full-nfc-afc-rosters|title=2019 Pro Bowl selections for every team: Full NFC, AFC rosters|date=2018-12-19|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/sports/football/parity-afc-becomes-a-conference-of-haves-and-have-nots.html|title=Parity?

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;
This chart of the [[2018 NFL season#Regular season standings|2018 season standings]] displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [[2018 New England Patriots season|Patriots in 2018]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[AFC East]]. Thus, [[2019 New England Patriots season|in 2019]], the Patriots will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[AFC North]] and [[NFC East]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[AFC South]] and [[AFC West]] (highlighted in orange).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the four division winners and two [[wild card (sports)|wild cards]] (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the AFC qualify for the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]]. The AFC playoffs culminate in the [[AFC Championship Game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

==History==
[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]]
Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL–NFL merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football – History|access-date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the NFL's Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central. Upon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970, the newly-minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]]; the National Football Conference, however, could not agree upon their setup, and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16, 1970.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to Indianapolis. In 1995, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|dispute]] between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the [[Baltimore Ravens]] with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL. The Ravens were treated as an expansion team.

In California, the [[Oakland Raiders]] relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, and back to Oakland in 1995, while the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] returned to Los Angeles in 2017 after 56 years in San Diego.

The [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the [[Tennessee Titans]].

The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the [[Houston Texans]] to the AFC. With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup has remained static ever since.

Between 1995 and 2018, the AFC has sent less than half of the 16 AFC teams to the [[Super Bowl]] with only 7 of the 16 individual teams making it. [[New England Patriots]] (10 times), [[Denver Broncos]] (4 times), [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (4 times), [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), [[Oakland Raiders]] (1 time), and [[Tennessee Titans]] (1 time). By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Washington Redskins]] missing out on an appearance in the [[Super Bowl]]. 16 of the last 18 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Ben Roethlisberger]] - in the Super Bowl. The AFC has started 5 quarterbacks in the last 18 Super Bowls, while the NFC has started 14.

==Logo==
[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo used from 1970 to 2009|216x216px]]
The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the "A" and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |access-date=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archivedate=May 6, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
[[NFL on NBC|NBC]] aired the AFC's Sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season. From 1998 to 2013, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC. Since 2014, select AFC games are cross-flexed from CBS to [[Fox NFL|Fox]]. Since 1990, select AFC playoff games have aired on ABC or ESPN.

The [[National Football League]] (NFL) is the premier [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[American football]] league in the United States, and is also one of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports leagues]]. However, the NFL is not without its share of controversies. Throughout history, everything from questionable championship rulings to team relocation decisions to allegedly criminal behavior by players has been part of the conversation surrounding the NFL. Many of the recent controversies have surrounded NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], player conduct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyel |first=Gregg |url=http://www.cbssports.com/columns/story/13243927/goodells-conduct-policy-veering-from-mostly-right-to-all-wrong |title=Goodell's conduct policy veering from mostly right to all wrong |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=2010-04-18 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or the league's role in player safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Clifton |last=Brown |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2012-05-08/can-safety-violence-co-exist-nfl-faces-daunting-future |title=NFL concussion conundrum: Can safety, violence co-exist? Challenge is daunting – NFL – Sporting News |publisher=AOL.SportingNews.com |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1925 NFL Championship==
{{main|1925 NFL Championship controversy}}

The 1925 NFL Championship, officially held by the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], has been the subject of controversy since it was awarded. Under the league rules during that time, the NFL title was automatically given to the team with the best record at the end of the season instead of having the winner be determined by a playoff tournament. There was an open-ended schedule during that season; although the final listed league games ended on December 6, teams could still schedule contests against each other through December 20 to make more money.

The [[Pottsville Maroons]] were one of the dominant teams of the [[1925 NFL season|1925 season]], and after defeating the Cardinals on December 6, came away with the best record in the league. However, NFL commissioner [[Joseph Carr]] suspended and removed the Maroons from the NFL after they played an unauthorized exhibition game in [[Philadelphia]], on the grounds that they had violated the territorial rights of the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. The Cardinals played and won two more games against weak NFL opponents, giving them a superior record, and were awarded the title.

Pottsville supporters argue that the suspension was illegitimate, and that the Maroons, who were reinstated the next year, would have had the superior record had they not been suspended. Others{{Who|date=September 2015}} claim that Chicago was the legitimate champions based on the rules of the time. The NFL has investigated Pottsville's case on two occasions, both times upholding its decision that the Cardinals are the 1925 champions.

==Team relocation controversies==
{{main|National Football League franchise moves and mergers}}

===Baltimore Colts move to Indianapolis===
{{main|Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis}}
The [[Baltimore Colts]] were moved to [[Indianapolis]] by owner [[Robert Irsay]] in 1984, after multiple years of lobbying to renovate or replace the decrepit [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], including talks of a "Baltodome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5sKmJItUF4C&amp;pg=PA112 |title=Glory for Sale: Fans, Dollars, and the New NFL – Jon Morgan – Google Books |date=1995-11-06 |accessdate=2012-07-21|isbn=9780963124654 |last1=Morgan |first1=Jon }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the Hoosier Dome (later called the [[RCA Dome]]) was built in Indianapolis, increasing interest in a move by the Colts. Eventually, the Colts moved to Indianapolis with the help of the moving company [[Mayflower Transit]], who did so at night to confuse the [[Maryland State Police]] and fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonesaw.tripod.com/Indy_History.htm |title=History of the Indianapolis Colts |publisher=Bonesaw.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Browns move to Baltimore===
{{main|Cleveland Browns relocation controversy}}
[[Cleveland Browns]] owner [[Art Modell]] decided to move the Browns to [[Baltimore]], 12 years after the Colts moved away from the city. After backlash from the fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/sports/pro-football-a-city-fights-to-save-the-browns.html?ref=art_modell&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Sandomir | title=PRO FOOTBALL;A City Fights To Save The Browns | date=1995-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team and the NFL decided on a special compromise: Modell could relocate the Browns to Baltimore, but would play as an "expansion team", and the Browns will go into a state of "suspended operations". Modell's new team would eventually be named the [[Baltimore Ravens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/sports/football-baltimore-browns-may-be-a-done-deal.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Timothy W. | last=Smith | title=FOOTBALL;Baltimore Browns May Be a Done Deal | date=1995-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Cleveland Browns returned to the league as an [[expansion team]]. Similar agreements would eventually be used for the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in their [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|relocation to Oklahoma City]] to become the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nba/2008127774_websoni20.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Jeff | last=Latzke | title=Seattle to retain SuperSonics banners and trophies | date=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in their move to become the [[Houston Dynamo]] (a new Earthquakes team eventually returned).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/quakes/2005-12-15-relocation-houston_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=San Jose's MLS team moving to Houston | date=2005-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Louis Rams move to Los Angeles===
On April 13, 1995, [[Stan Kroenke]] helped [[Georgia Frontiere]] move the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] from [[Anaheim]] to [[St. Louis]] by purchasing a 30% share of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-13/news/mn-54268_1_rams-owner|title=NFL Owners OK Rams' Move to St. Louis|date=13 April 1995|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, as a majority stock holder, Kroenke said: "I'm going to attempt to do everything that I can to keep the Rams in St. Louis. Just as I did everything that I could to bring the team to St. Louis in 1995. I believe my actions speak for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/from-the-archives-kroenke-s-pledge-to-keep-the-rams/article_3b49e97d-2799-50aa-8b7b-5a82bf5d5a4b.html|title=Kroenke's pledge to keep the Rams in St. Louis|date=21 April 2010|work=St. Louis Post Dispatch|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, [[Stan Kroenke]] purchased the Rams using a [[Right of first refusal]] clause in the last minute of bidding, beating a high bid from [[Shahid Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5496516|title=Stan Kroenke is new Rams owner|date=25 August 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the Rams and the City of St. Louis went to arbitration over a clause in the Rams lease that stated the Rams current stadium must be in the top tier of NFL Stadiums.  The arbitrators agreed with the Rams, giving the Rams the ability to break their original lease and go to a year to year lease agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/02/rams-win-stadium-arbitration/|title=Rams win stadium arbitration|work=nbcsports.com|date=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 5, 2015, it was announced that the [[Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment|Kroenke Group]] was teaming up with [[Stockbridge Capital Group]] to build [[SoFi Stadium|a 70,000 seat NFL stadium]] and venue in [[Inglewood, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles, threatening the Rams' future in St. Louis.

On January 12, 2016, the NFL approved the Rams' application to relocate from St. Louis back to Los Angeles with a 30-2, although the move was generally considered malicious by fans in St. Louis citing how the NFL had its hand in the pot the whole time and St. Louis had a stadium plan in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14558668/st-louis-rams-relocate-los-angeles|title=Rams headed back to Los Angeles; Chargers have option to join|date=13 January 2016|work=ESPN|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Jim|title=NFL owners thrilled by Kroenke's move|url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/football/professional/nfl-owners-thrilled-by-kroenke-s-move/article_09762b03-a87e-5c6b-a9fa-250bb46450ae.html|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial $200 million as a standard part of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s G4 stadium loan, plus the additional $100 requested from St. Louis totaled $300 million which the NFL ultimately deemed inadequate, was then granted to [[Oakland]] and [[San Diego]] to maintain their respected teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Florio|first1=Mike|title=Goodell reminds San Diego that $300 million is available for stadium|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/01/29/goodell-reminds-san-diego-that-300-million-is-available-for-stadium/|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2016, at a [[St. Louis Blues]] game, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] Owner and Blues Owner dropped a puck together to celebrate the "best sports city in America", as the crowd chanted "Kroenke sucks!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/14572783/st-louis-blues-fans-chant-kroenke-sucks-amid-ceremonial-puck-drop|title=St. Louis fans chant 'Kroenke sucks' amid ceremonial puck drop|date=14 January 2016|work=KMOV|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported by many sources that the Rams, although changing their name and city to Los Angeles, were still trying to get players to sign contracts with Missouri as the state of their employer, suspected in part with the relaxed Workers Rights laws in Missouri vs. the much stricter California laws. The NFL Players union has told all agents to not accept any contracts until the verbiage is changed for the Rams to be a California employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/03/stan-kroenke-rams-move-to-los-angeles-workers-compensation|title=The Rams just hit St. Louis with the worst slap in the face yet|date=12 March 2016|work=USAToday.com|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016 prior St. Louis Rams COO [[Kevin Demoff]], expressed gratitude for the St. Louis Rams going on a losing streak in 2015 to give the relocation team more time to calculate a move to LA quoted with saying - "we went on a four game losing streak in the middle of November. So, we went from being in the playoff hunt and having a seed to out of the playoff hunt. That allowed us to have more time to talk about this, to put things together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox2now.com/2016/03/14/fans-shocked-to-hear-demoff-happy-about-st-louis-rams-losing-season/|title=Fans shocked to hear Demoff happy about St. Louis Rams' losing season|date=14 March 2016|work=fox2now.com|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Demoff, who was born in Los Angeles, joined the St. Louis Rams in 2009 just weeks before Stan Kroenke gained majority leader. Demoff also ran the [[Los Angeles Avengers]], an Arena Football league in Los Angeles in the early 2000s. Demoff was quoted as saying - "the league has handed Stan and the Rams their greatest opportunity in the last two decades: entry into L.A." suggesting the league had a large role in the relocation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2016/04/04/Forty-Under-40/Kevin-Demoff.aspx|title=Forty Under 40: Kevin Demoff|date=4 April 2016|work=sportsbusinessdaily.com|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Player conduct==
{{main|National Football League player conduct controversy}}
In 2007, [[Roger Goodell]] became commissioner, and instituted a player conduct policy to help control off-field behavior by players.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"&gt;[[Associated Press]].

Fred Smoot was allegedly the ringleader of the party, and allegedly pushed a double-headed [[dildo]] into the [[vagina]]s of two women who were lying on the floor in the lounge area.

In 2006, [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]] was involved in a [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring, and over seventy dogs, with most of them being [[pit bull terrier]]s, with some said to be showing signs of injuries, were seized, along with physical evidence during several searches of Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property by local, state and federal authorities. During the investigation, Vick was revealed to be working with 4 others (Tony Taylor, Purnell Anthony Peace, Quanis Lavell Philips, and Oscar Allen). Eventually, they were convicted for "Conspiracy in interstate commerce/aid of unlawful animal cruelty venture". On September 13, Vick tested positive for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and was ordered by federal judge Henry E. Hudson to "submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance", and before getting sent to prison, Vick was placed under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vick Fails Drug Test, Under House Arrest | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/26/vick/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending time at Northern Neck Regional Jail in [[Warsaw, Virginia]] awaiting his trial, on December 10, Vick was given 23 months in federal prison, followed by 3 years of probation. Vick was later placed in [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth]] until 2009. Vick was later released by the Falcons, and signed with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vick, Eagles agree to 2-year deal |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-08-14 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4397938 |accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banned substances===

Players' usage of [[anabolic steroid|steroids]] has been forbidden by the league since 1987, with players testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs being suspended without pay for four games for the first offense (a quarter of the regular season), eight games for a second offense (half of the regular season), and 12 months for a third offense.&lt;ref name="Banned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflpa.org/pdfs/RulesAndRegs/BannedSubstances.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624231704/http://www.nflpa.org/pdfs/RulesAndRegs/BannedSubstances.pdf|archivedate=June 24, 2008|title=NFLPA.org|publisher=NFLPA.org|accessdate=May 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been praised by some&lt;ref name="Apr28"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21734-2005Apr28.html |title=NFL's Steroid Policy Gets Kudos on Capitol Hill |work=The Washington Post |date=April 28, 2005 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 | first1=Mark | last1=Maske | first2=Leonard | last2=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by others.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|author=Joel Roberts |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/27/national/main691147_page3.shtml |title=NFL Steroid Policy 'Not Perfect', House Committee Praises Tougher Testing Policy, But Still May Act – CBS News |publisher=CBSNews.com |date=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, former [[San Diego Chargers]] player [[Shawne Merriman]] tested positive for steroids, and was given a 4-game suspension.

On December 27, 2015, [[Al Jazeera America]] released [[The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers|a report]] conducted by the [[Al Jazeera America#Al Jazeera Investigative Unit|Al Jazeera Investigative Unit]] investigating professional athletes' use of [[Performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) which named [[Peyton Manning]], among other prominent athletes, as having received illegal drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011. The report involved Liam Collins, a British hurdler, going undercover in an attempt to obtain banned substances from Sly and other medical professionals. The report claimed that Manning's wife, Ashley, had been shipped [[Off-label use|off-label]] [[Growth hormone|human growth hormone]] (HGH) by the Guyer Institute during the fall of 2011 while Manning was out with a severe neck injury, with the intention of hiding that Manning was the one actually receiving the drugs.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/dark-side-secrets-sports-dopers-151227133355144.html |title=The dark side: The secret world of sports doping |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14441114/documentary-links-peyton-manning-other-pro-athletes-use-peds |title=Documentary links Peyton Manning, other pro athletes to use of PEDs |website=Espn.go.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-reporter-stresses-that-no-allegation-is-being-made-against-peyton-manning/ |title=Al Jazeera reporter stresses that no allegation is being made against Peyton Manning &amp;#124; ProFootballTalk |website=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jazeera reported on January 3, 2016, that they were in contact with a second source, who was "impeccably placed, knowledgeable[sic], and credible" and was a former employee at the Guyer Institute, which confirms Sly's allegation that HGH was sent to Ashley Manning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Timothy Burke |url=http://deadspin.com/al-jazeera-reporter-second-knowledgable-and-credible-1750778458 |title=Al Jazeera Reporter: Second "Knowledgable And Credible" Source Confirms HGH Sent To Manning House |website=Deadspin.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicki Jhabvala |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_29338568/al-jazeera-reporter-says-second-source-confirmed-hgh |title=Al-Jazeera reporter says second source confirmed HGH shipments to Ashley Manning |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 2016, it was confirmed that Ashley Manning did receive shipments from the Guyer Institute, but refused to confirm that the shipments had included HGH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14718227/peyton-manning-legal-team-looked-al-jazeera-documentary |title=Peyton Manning's legal team looked into Al Jazeera documentary |website=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a database compiled by ''USA Today'' in 2014, 85 of the 713 arrests of NFL players since 2000 were due to [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez|first1=Michael|last2=Riojas|first2=Priscilla|title=NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/09/us/nfl-players-domestic-violence-accusations/|work=CNN|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 2014, ''[[TMZ|TMZ Sports]]'' released a video of Baltimore Ravens running back [[Ray Rice]] punching his fiancée and dragging her unconscious body out of an elevator led to a two-game suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Rice -- ELEVATOR KNOCKOUT ...

Carolina Panthers defensive end [[Greg Hardy]] was accused of assaulting an ex-girlfriend in June 2014. He was disciplined by neither his team nor the NFL and has been allowed to continue playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Sean|title=The Convicted Abuser Who's Still Playing In The NFL|url=https://time.com/3329416/greg-hardy-nfl-domestic-violence/|work=Time|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 female [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] urged the league to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arit|first1=John|title=Sixteen Female Senators Pressure NFL to Adopt Zero-Tolerance Domestic Violence Policy|url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/09/sixteen-female-senators-pressure-nfl-to-adopt-zero-tolerance-domestic-violence-policy/380064/|work=The Wire|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the aforementioned incidents, there were a number of PSAs led by NOMORE.org and over a dozen former and current NFL players that aired during NFL games. The purpose of the PSAs were to promote the NOMORE.org campaign of saying no more to domestic violence and raising awareness about the problems surrounding domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;"NFL Players Say No More PSAs."

===Player politics===
The NFL has received polarized opinions related to certain political agendas. For example: 	

*The NFL denied the [[Dallas Cowboys]] request to honor fallen police officers in wake of the [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-denies-cowboys-request-to-wear-helmet-decal-honoring-dallas-police-officers-081116 | work=Foxsports.com | title=NFL denies Cowboys' request to wear helmet decal honoring Dallas police | date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the [[National Anthem]] in protest of police violence, which led to [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016-present)|widespread controversy surrounding the national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem | work=NFL.com | title=Colin Kaepernick explains why he sat during national anthem | date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The NFL initially stated they would fine players for wearing [[September 11 attacks]] tribute cleats, which the NFL ultimately did not do due to backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/13/12888178/nfl-odell-beckham-victor-cruz-pat-mcafee-911-fines-cleats | work=sbnation.com | title=NFL won't fine players who wore 9/11 tribute cleats | date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As mentioned above, during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons, many NFL players from all 32 NFL teams have protested the national anthem due to police brutality, racial inequality, and other controversies around the nation surrounding politics and authority. Players have been caught on camera kneeling, sitting, staying in the locker rooms, and raising their fists while the national anthem was played before kickoffs of games. This led to dropped ratings throughout the NFL, with most fans and critics calling the protests disrespectful. Many videos on YouTube showed fans showing their anger towards players by burning merchandise such as hats, jersies, pictures, and other things. Though the incidents have died down during the 2018 season, they still continue to happen throughout the league. Aside from the NFL, other sports leagues have joined in the protests, such as high school football. This lead to President Donald Trump lamenting "Get that son of a bitch off of the field right now! He's gone! He's fired! Fired!" This line has been both praised and criticized by fans and media alike, with some agreeing that anyone who kneels should be banned, while others say it is too harsh. Ultimately, in 2018, the NFL introduced a policy revolving around the issue.

===Sexual assault lawsuits===
There have been several cases of high-profile sexual assault lawsuits filed against prominent NFL players. These lawsuits have varied in severity of accusation, settlement and punishment, both in court and from the league.

In 1996, while attending the University of Tennessee, quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] was accused of [[sexual assault]] by trainer Jamie Ann Naughright of pressing his genitals against Naughright's face during a foot examination. Manning claims that he was just pulling a prank by "[[mooning]]" another athlete in the room as Naughright bent over to examine him.  Both Naughright and the other athlete deny Manning's story. Naughright settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure in four incidents, and resigned from the school.  She had initially made a list of 33 complaints about the school.&lt;ref name="chronicle.augusta.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1997/08/20/oth_213271.shtml#.Vje0i5RHaK1|title=Trainer's settlement involved more than Manning's mooning|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Augusta Chronicle]]|date=August 20, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Peyton Manning and three other parties in 2002. Manning allegedly defamed her in a book he wrote with his father and author John Underwood. The lawsuit was settled after the court ruled there was sufficient evidence for it to be heard by a jury. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed due to confidentiality terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/colts/2003-12-25-manning-lawsuit_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com – Peyton Manning defamation lawsuit resolved|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/02/14/peyton-manning-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-documents-tennessee|title=Documents reveal more litigation in Manning case|first=Michael|last=McCann|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was accused by two women of sexual assault in separate lawsuits, one in Nevada and the other in the state of Georgia. While the first case was muddled with evidence of the accuser bragging of having consensual sex with Roethlisberger prior to filing suit,&lt;ref name="Antonetti-Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09220/989640-66.stm#ixzz0Nq1oEgKL|title=Woman's affidavit supports Roethlisberger's denial of sexual assault|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2009|author=Michael A.

==Coaching controversies==

===Bounty Bowl===
{{main|Bounty Bowl}}
In 1989, [[Cowboys-Eagles rivalry|rivals]] [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] and [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] played two games. Later, it was discovered that Eagles head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] had placed a bounty on Cowboys and former Eagles kicker [[Luis Zendejas]]. Concerns first came around when Ryan was the defensive coordinator for the [[Chicago Bears]], who allegedly pooled money into a bag, and if any of the Bears defensive players injures a player, he would get the bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times file photo |url=http://www.nj.com/times-sports/index.ssf/2012/03/saints_bountygate_brings_back.html |title=Saints' "Bountygate" brings back memories of Eagles' "Bounty Bowl" |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicions started in the game when various fights happened between the two teams, with Zendejas going out of the game with a concussion from a hard tackle by linebacker [[Jessie Small]] after a kickoff. After the game, Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] alleged that Ryan had placed a bounty on two players: Zendejas and quarterback [[Troy Aikman]], with injuring Aikman being worth possibly $500. However, Ryan dismissed the claims as "high school Charlie stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-03-07/sports/31132527_1_eagles-coach-buddy-ryan-bounty-bowl-luis-zendejas |title=1989 Eagles recall original Bounty Bowl|publisher=Philly.com |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zendejas later claimed that when he was with the Eagles, a player had once received at least $100–200 each for hits on a kicker and punter, which was the reason why Johnson made the accusation.

In the teams' second meeting, this time in [[Veterans Stadium]] in Philadelphia, the original game set the tone for the second game, especially with NFL commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] at the game. Because the snow at the game has yet to be removed, the Eagles' [[700 Level|notoriously rowdy fans]], with a mixture of beer, the snow, the bounty and the hatred for "[[America's Team]]", threw everything within reach at various targets, like back judge [[Al Jury]], who was knocked to the ground by a barrage of [[snowball]]s; Cowboys punter [[Mike Saxon]], who was targeted in the end zone; and Johnson, who was hit with snowballs, ice, and beer as he was escorted off the field by Philadelphia police. The Eagles won both contests, winning the first game 27-0, and the second 20-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KevinR38 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSroPtp4jTI |title=1989 Bounty Bowl II |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-19 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 National Football League videotaping controversy===
{{main|2007 National Football League videotaping controversy}}
Dubbed Spygate, in 2007, despite the [[New England Patriots]] going [[2007 New England Patriots season|16-0]] for the first time in league history, the team was still in the midst of a controversy surrounding head coach [[Bill Belichick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2007-09-12-belichick-apology_N.htm |title=Belichick apologizes for 'Videogate' |first=Tom |last=Pedulla |work=USA Today |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22190391/ |title=Jets play innocent, wonder 'What is 'Spygate?' |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[MSNBC.com]] |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2008-01-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113034635/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22190391/ |archivedate=13 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the season, the Patriots were caught videotaping the hand signals of a [[New York Jets]] coach from a non-fixed roof covered position, and Belichick was fined a league-high $500,000, and the Patriots were fined $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots lost their first-round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] (if they made the playoffs), or their second- and third-round picks (if they missed the playoffs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3018338 |title=Belichick draws $500,000 fine, but avoids suspension – NFL|publisher=ESPN |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely criticized move, the league destroyed the tapes.&lt;ref name="ESPN.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3392047 |title=Timeline of events and disclosures during Spygate saga |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517030557/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3392047 |archivedate=17 May 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Belichick and most other coaches were then revealed to have done this in the past until it was stopped by memo from Roger Goodell.  Belichick's stance was that the rule does not allow videotaping from a mobile camera and the information then used in the same game. The NFL found that Belichick did not use the tape during the same game, yet penalized him more than any other coach in history.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AvAGEAUu07N_iO6wj7sJQKk5nYcB?slug=ap-goodell-specter&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Belichick has been taping since 2000, Goodell tells Specter |first=Kellman |last=Laurie |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Yahoo!

A congressional inquiry that would put league officials under oath had to be avoided, Martz recalls Goodell telling him. "If it ever got to an investigation, it would be terrible for the league," Goodell said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/9/8/9275433/espn-patriots-spygate-deflategate-roger-goodell-bill-belichick|title=ESPN just nuked the Patriots and NFL for Spygate|date=8 September 2015|work=SB Nation|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 New Orleans Saints bounty scandal===
{{main|New Orleans Saints bounty scandal}}
In 2012, the [[New Orleans Saints]] were discovered to have run a "slush fund" under former defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]], that paid out bonuses, called "bounties", to purposely injure offensive players that the Saints were playing against. The system was known to have operated during Williams's time in [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Graham |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/bills-nfl/article747663.ece |title=Bills bounty system under Williams alleged – Bills &amp; NFL |work=The Buffalo News |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington Redskins|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/washington-redskins-offered-bounties-for-big-hits-under-former-assistant-coach-gregg-williams/2012/03/02/gIQAH0RlnR_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Mark | last=Maske | title=Stats, scores and schedules | date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors started in 2009 during the Saints [[Super Bowl XLIV]] run in the 2009 NFC Championship game against the Vikings, where the Saints defense was allegedly trying to hurt Viking quarterback [[Brett Favre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverman |first=Steve |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ycn-11050204 |title='Bountygate' Details Get Uglier by the Moment – NFL|work=Yahoo!

Williams also told them to injure [[Vernon Davis]]' ankles and [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tear]] wide receiver [[Michael Crabtree]]'s [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]]. According to Pamphilon, Williams also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback [[Alex Smith]] after he told his men to hit Smith in the chin, "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers -- the cash sign -- and says, 'I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Anw9sHdXItbteN7R4ozB1Qg5nYcB?slug=ms-silver_gregg_williams_speech_saints_49ers_bounty_040412|title=Source: Gregg Williams instructed Saints during speech to injure Niners offensive players|last=Silver|first=Michael|work=[[Yahoo!

Ultimately, Goodell handed down one of the harshest penalties in league history, by suspending Williams indefinitely, head coach [[Sean Payton]] for the [[2012 New Orleans Saints season|2012 season]], interim head coach [[Joe Vitt]] for the first six games, and general manager [[Mickey Loomis]] for eight games.&lt;ref name="sanction"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL suspends Saints coach Payton for one year without pay|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c0dd9/article/nfl-suspends-saints-coach-payton-for-one-year-without-pay?module=HP11_breaking_news|work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saints linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] was also suspended for the season, as well as defensive linemen [[Anthony Hargrove]] and [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]] for eight and four games, respectively.

==Player safety==
{{further|Concussions in American football}}
There has been widespread controversy over the league's part in player safety. Goodell has fined Lions player [[Ndamukong Suh]] for stomping, as well as Steelers linebacker [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]] for a hard tackle, as well as suspending the 2 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/james-harrisons-hit-on-colt-mccoy-draws-attention/2011/12/09/gIQAz539hO_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Cindy | last=Boren | title=Stats, scores and schedules | date=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league has also been criticized for its efforts in preventing concussions, in which eight former players have died, and have also had concussions throughout their careers. In 1994, former commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] created the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee in order to study the effects of concussions on players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3644940|title=Elliot Pellman says it's okay to play in the NFL after suffering a concussion|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the suicide of linebacker [[Junior Seau]] in 2012, concerns arose about the connection between player deaths and concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=267&amp;sid=2852304 |title=Seau's death raises questions about kids' concussions |publisher=WTOP.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, on April 9, 2013, a lawsuit involving 4,100 plaintiffs and 222 consolidated lawsuits against the NFL will be held by a federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breer|first=Albert|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000158376/article/concussion-lawsuit-state-of-things-entering-tuesdays-hearing|title=Concussion lawsuit: State of things entering Tuesday's hearing|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-04-08|accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Bennet Omalu]] found evidence of [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] in the brain of former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] player [[Mike Webster]]. The NFL initially hounded Omalu and tried to force him to withdraw his findings. Since this discovery, however, 91 other former NFL players have been tested for CTE at the VA-BU-CLF Brain bank at [[Boston University]], with 87 of these tests showing signs of CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://concussionfoundation.org/learning-center/what-is-cte|title=What is CTE?|website=Concussion Legacy Foundation|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Bennet Omalu has since been made into a [[Concussion (2015 film)|major motion picture]].

Also, in recent years, the number of [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tears and other serious knee injuries has gone up, including in 2013 an increase of 64 percent from 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-09/gronkowski-spotlights-nfl-s-60-surge-in-knee-injuries-from-2011|title=Rob Gronkowski's Knee Injury Spotlights NFL's Surge in ACL Tears|date=10 December 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/95723/inside-slant-big-spike-in-acl-injuries|title=Inside Slant: Big spike in ACL injuries|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Washington Redskins]] have been subject to [[Native American mascot controversy|dispute]] with some in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] community for many years claiming the term "[[redskin]]" to be derogatory towards Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2009/11/the-washington-redskins-controversy-an-interview-with-amanda-blackhorse/ |title=The Washington Redskins Controversy: An Interview with Amanda Blackhorse « Above the Law: A Legal Web Site – News, Commentary, and Opinions on Law Firms, Lawyers, Law School, Law Suits, Judges and Courts |publisher=Abovethelaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free agency==
The league's [[free agent|free agency]] system originally used a system that was adopted from [[Major League Baseball]], where a player stays with a team until his contract expires, then can negotiate with the team to stay. In 1947, the league adopted the 1-year system, where a team can only renew a player's contract for one year. In 1963, the "[[Pete Rozelle|Rozelle]] Rule" was created, where a team that signs a player must compensate for the player's expenses from his previous team. If a team refuses, commissioner Rozelle decided the compensation. The players union found this system to be unfair, and eventually won a court action in 1976. However, the league's [[collective bargaining agreement]] still kept the compensation rule, but removed Rozelle's authority. Ultimately, in {{NFL Year|1987}}, the players union went on strike. Two years later, the union sued again, but was prohibited from suing the league for [[antitrust laws|anti-trust]]. From 1989 to 1992, instead of the current free agent system, the league used a system to acquire and release players called [[Plan B free agency]]. The system consisted of teams protecting 37 players, and having the remaining players becoming unrestricted free agents. The players eventually decertified the union, leading to players filing individual lawsuits.&lt;ref name=BleacherReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/18183-nfl-history-the-road-to-free-agency |title=NFL History: The Road to Free Agency |website=Bleacher Report |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eight players sued the league for violating their antitrust laws, and calling the system an unfair trade restraint. The system ultimately was deemed illegal by the jury, and was ended in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Mike.

===2011 lockout===
{{main|2011 NFL lockout}}
However, in 2011, the league and the [[National Football League Players Association]] eventually failed to arrive at a consensus for the [[National Football League collective bargaining agreement|collective bargaining agreement (CBA)]], and eventually led to the lockout on March 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wivb.com/dpp/sports/bills_and_nfl/other_nfl/nfl-lockout-begins |title=NFL Lockout Begins |publisher=WIVB.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lockout threatened to cancel games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Brandon/The Times-Picayune |url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2011/04/if_nfl_lockout_lingers_games_i.html |title=If NFL lockout lingers, games in Week 2 and Week 4 could potentially be cancelled – New Orleans Saints Football NFL News |newspaper=NOLA.com |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though only the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-22/sports/ct-spt-0722-olivet-bears-chicago--20110722_1_bears-and-rams-training-camp-free-agents |title=NFL lockout: Hall of Fame Game exhibition canceled; Chicago Bears could report to training camp Wednesday if NFL players ratify deal|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lockout eventually ended on July 21 with a new CBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schefter|first=Adam |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6797238/2011-nfl-lockout-owners-players-come-deal-all-points-sources-say |title=2011 NFL lockout – Owners, players come to deal on all points, sources say|publisher=ESPN |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-and-nflpa-agree-to-terms-of-new-collective-bargaining-agreement-072511 |title=Sources: NFL, NFLPA agree to terms of new CBA – NFL News &amp;#124; FOX Sports on MSN |publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|FOX Sports]] |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referee labor dispute==
{{main|2012 NFL referee lockout}}
In {{NFL Year|2012}}, the league and the NFL Referees Association became involved in a dispute over the collective bargaining agreement between the two parties. Eventually, the league then locked out the officials in June, and turned to replacement officials to officiate the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/story/_/id/8314433/nfl-use-replacement-officials-start-regular-season |title=NFL to use replacement officials for start of regular season – ESPN Chicago |publisher=ESPN |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the association filed a complaint to the [[National Labor Relations Board]] against the league for unfair labor practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/06/21/nfl-referees-unfair-labor.ap/index.html#ixzz212R1eXRa |title=NFL Referees Association files unfair labor practice charge against league – NFL|work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date= 2012-06-21|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement referees were met with criticism from fans, players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/45289/robbie-gould-replacement-officials-clueless | title=Robbie Gould: Replacement refs 'clueless' | publisher=ESPN | date=August 24, 2012 | accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/belichick-fined-50k-shanahan-25k-174534755--nfl.html |title=Belichick fined 50K, Kyle Shanahan 25K by NFL|work=Yahoo!

==Expansion draft==
Originally, the NFL did not have an [[expansion draft]], and instead, expansion teams were given whatever players were available; the rules at the time gave these teams two players from each existing franchise and the remainder from the local area to make up a 55-player roster. When the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were added to the NFL in 1976, their roster ended up being composed mostly of aging veterans and inexperienced rookies, and as a result, Tampa Bay had the first winless season in modern NFL history en route to losing their first 26 games (the longest losing streak in NFL history). After significant public criticism, the NFL created an expansion draft to avoid a repeat of this very poor start for future expansion teams.

==Controversial calls==
{{See also|List of NFL nicknames#Rules named after NFL figures|label 1=Rules named after NFL figures}}

The league has been criticized for various calls that would later be disputed, and would also lead to a segment on [[NFL Top 10]] called ''Top Ten Most Controversial Calls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-total-access/09000d5d8187af4c/Top-10-controversial-calls |title=NFL Videos: Top 10 controversial calls |publisher=NFL.com |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these controversial calls have directly led to rule changes.

===Immaculate Reception===
{{main|Immaculate Reception}}
In the [[1972–73 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 13, Oakland Raiders 7|1972 AFC Wild Card Game]], the Steelers and Raiders fought to a 7-6 lead for Oakland. With 22 seconds left in the game, Steelers quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] heaved a pass towards [[John Fuqua]], and Raiders safety [[Jack Tatum]] collided with Fuqua at the same time as the ball's arrival. Tatum's hit knocked Fuqua down and the ball flying backwards. Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]], who had been heading downfield in the event that Bradshaw needed another receiver, caught the ball before it hit the ground and ran for the game-winning touchdown. However, fans and critics eventually asked the question: Whom did the ball touch in the Tatum/Fuqua collision? If it hit only Fuqua, the pass would've been illegal under the rules at the time, and Oakland would have won; if it hit Tatum, or both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order), it would have been legal. The rule stated that once an offensive player touches a pass, he is the only offensive player that can catch the pass. However, if a defensive player touches the pass "first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one [offensive] player, then all [offensive] players become and remain eligible" to catch the pass.&lt;ref&gt;Official Rules for Professional Football 1971, The National Football League, Rule 7, Section 5, Article 2, Item 1, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steelersfever.com/immaculate_reception.html |title=Immaculate Reception |publisher=Steelers Fever |date=1972-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy Roller===
{{main|Holy Roller (American football)}}
In 1978, the [[Oakland Raiders]] were trailing the [[San Diego Chargers]] 20-14 with 10 seconds left in the game. Raiders quarterback [[Ken Stabler]] took the snap, and saw Chargers linebacker [[Woodrow Lowe]] about to sack him. Stabler eventually deliberately fumbled the ball towards San Diego's goal line, where running back [[Pete Banaszak]] attempted to recover, but lost his footing and sent the ball closer to the end zone. Tight end [[Dave Casper]] attempted to pick it up, but was unable to, and kicked the ball into the end zone, where he recovered it for the game-tying touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Media |first=Raiders |url=http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/The-Holy-Roller/18355482-ad78-43cd-9bf8-da77e709fecf |title=The Holy Roller |publisher=Raiders.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later led to disputes over whether or not Banaszak and Casper intentionally batted the ball forward, which would be a penalty, as well as whether or not Stabler fumbled the ball or threw a forward pass. The play was eventually ruled as legal. The Raiders would then make the extra point to win 21-20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1737 |title=History Release » The "Holy Roller" |publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] |date=1978-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing off-season, the league enacted the so-called "Ken Stabler Rule": on fourth down at any time in the game or any down in the final two minutes of a half, if a player fumbles forward, only the fumbling player can recover and/or advance the ball. If that player's teammate recovers the ball, it is placed back at the spot of the fumble.&lt;ref name="rulesname"&gt;

===1979 AFC Championship===
{{main|1979–80 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Houston Oilers 13}}
Against the Steelers in the [[1979–80 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Houston Oilers 13|1979 AFC Championship Game]], the [[Houston Oilers]] fell behind 17-10 late in the third quarter. Oilers quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] then threw a pass to [[Mike Renfro]], who caught the ball in the back of the end zone. However, though television networks proved that Renfro was inbounds, instant replay was not in use at the time, and the referees ultimately ruled Renfro out of bounds. The Steelers would then score another touchdown and go to [[Super Bowl XIV]].&lt;ref name=PageTwo /&gt; The league would not institute instant replay until 1986.

===Music City Miracle===
{{main|Music City Miracle}}
The Titans and [[Buffalo Bills]] squared off in the [[1999–2000 NFL playoffs#AFC: Tennessee Titans 22, Buffalo Bills 16|1999 AFC Wild Card Game]], and the Bills led 16-15 with 16 seconds left in the game. After Bills kicker [[Steve Christie]] kicked off to Titans returner [[Lorenzo Neal]], Neal handed the ball to [[Frank Wycheck]], who then threw a lateral across the field to [[Kevin Dyson]], who then ran 75 yards for a touchdown and the lead. This then led to officials debating over whether or not Wycheck's pass was a forward pass or a lateral. Referee [[Phil Luckett]] then deemed the pass a lateral, giving Tennessee the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/music-city-miracle |title=Music City Miracle — History.com This Day in History — 1/8/2000 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1999–2000 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: St. Louis Rams 11, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 6|1999 NFC Championship Game]], the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] trailed the [[St. Louis Rams]] by 5 points. With 47 seconds left in the game, Buccaneers quarterback [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]] threw an 11-yard pass to [[Bert Emanuel]], who caught the ball, but had the play overturned after the ball touched the ground, giving the Rams the trip to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]].&lt;ref name=PageTwo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/worstcalls/010730.html |title=ESPN.com – Page2 – The List: Worst calls in sports history |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BILL PENNINGTON|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/sports/pro-football-bucs-grounded-by-a-replay-call-voiding-a-catch.html |title=PRO FOOTBALL; Bucs Grounded By a Replay Call Voiding a Catch|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2000-01-24 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league then enacted the "Bert Emanuel Rule" after the season: the ball can touch the ground during a completed pass as long as the receiver maintains control of the ball.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.buccaneers.com/news/newsdetail.aspx?newsid=4980 | title=Buccaneers.com – The Answer Man, Series 3, Vol. 7 | date=2006-01-16 | accessdate=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.outsidethebeltway.com/2008/05/nfl-rules-named-after-players/ |title=NFL Rules Named After Players » OTB Sports |publisher=Sports.outsidethebeltway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottlegate===
{{main|Bottlegate}}
In a regular season game between the [[2001 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] and [[2001 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], the Browns were driving down the field for a potential game-winning touchdown in order to keep their playoff hopes alive. After Browns quarterback [[Tim Couch]] passed to receiver [[Quincy Morgan]] to convert a crucial fourth down, the catch appeared to be bobbled but the referees initially ruled a completion. Couch then spiked the ball with 48 seconds remaining, but the referees subsequently reviewed the previous play and overturned it, despite a rule that stipulated that a play cannot be reviewed after another play has been completed. The controversial decision, which effectively sealed the outcome of the game and eliminated the Browns from the playoffs, angered Browns fans, who started tossing plastic beer bottles onto the field and forced the refs to declare the game over until the league office called and ordered the final 48 seconds, which consisted of two kneeldowns by the Jaguars, to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2014/12/bottlegate_oral_history_cleveland_browns.html |title=An oral history of BottleGate, 13 years after Cleveland Browns fans stole the spotlight |last=Meisel |first=Zack |date=2014-12-16 |website=cleveland.com |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuck Rule===
{{main|Tuck Rule Game}}
During a 2001 AFC playoff game between the [[New England Patriots]] and [[Oakland Raiders]], the Raiders forced a fumble near the end of the game. The Raiders recovered the fumble, thereby securing their victory. However, the call went into review by the booth, and upon review it was determined to be an incomplete pass due to the [[Tuck rule (American football)|tuck rule]] being applied. Under the rule, if a passer "is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body."&lt;ref name="wparticle_tuck"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html|title=Tuck Rule Hard to Grasp|accessdate=2012-01-14 | work=The Washington Post | first=Mark | last=Maske | date=October 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriots went on to win the game and ultimately the Super Bowl. Fans and experts alike have disputed whether the call was correct, and whether the rule should even exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/11/mike-pereira-time-to-change-the-tuck-rule/ |title=Mike Pereira: Time to change the tuck rule &amp;#124; ProFootballTalk |publisher=ProFootballTalk.NBCSports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002 NFC Wild Card Game===
{{main|2002–03 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38}}
During the NFC wild card game between the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[New York Giants]], the Giants created a first half lead, which the 49ers overcame by scoring 25 points. Late in the game, the Giants, down by one point, attempted to kick the game-winning field goal with six seconds left. However, long snapper [[Trey Junkin]] botched the snap, leading to holder [[Matt Allen]] to throw a desperation pass to [[Rich Seubert]], which fell incomplete, giving San Francisco the win. During the play, a penalty was called, but on New York for having an illegal man downfield. However, Seubert actually did report, but a different Giants player was actually illegally downfield. The 49ers would also have been penalized for pass interference on defensive end [[Chike Okeafor]] for pulling down Seubert, which wasn't called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisman |first=Larry |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-01-06-giants-49ers-officials_x.htm |title=NFL: Officials missed pass interference call in Giants-49ers |work=USA Today |date=2003-01-07 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Super Bowl XL]], the [[Seattle Seahawks]] were denied a touchdown when officials called penalized Seahawks receiver [[Darrell Jackson]] for "pushing off" against [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] safety [[Chris Hope]] during Jackson's touchdown reception in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] scored on a quarterback sneak, and Seattle challenged the call, claiming that Roethlisberger did not break the plane of the end zone, but the play was confirmed after a review. In the fourth quarter, Seahawks tackle [[Sean Locklear]] was penalized for holding Steelers linebacker [[Clark Haggans]] during a long pass.

===2012 Packers–Seahawks game===
{{main|Fail Mary}}
On September 24, 2012, the [[Green Bay Packers]] faced the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on Monday Night Football. With the NFL and the league's regular referees [[2012 NFL referee lockout|locked in a contract dispute]], replacement officials were acquired to call the games for the first 3–4 weeks. As in previous games, there were many questionable calls made by the replacement officials during the game. In the 4th quarter, with only 8 seconds left in the game, the Packers were winning 12-7, with the Seahawks inside the 30-yard line, with one last play to decide the game. Seahawks quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] to the end zone. The pass ended up being caught by both Seahawks receiver [[Golden Tate]] and Packers defensive back [[M. D. Jennings]]. The two officials standing near the play each made their own call of the play. One official seemed to raise his arms to signal a Packers interception, while the other official raised his arms to signal a Seahawks touchdown. As with new NFL rules on instant replay, all touchdowns were liable to official review. The play was reviewed, while the Seahawks crowded the field in celebration. After a few minutes, full of controversy, the officials declared the play's ruling stood as a Seahawks touchdown, giving Seattle a 13-12 lead with the extra point pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL: Seahawks' victory stands|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8423928/nfl-statement-says-refs-made-right-call-end-game-green-bay-packers-seattle-seahawks|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost instantly, controversy reigned as replays showed that before the catch, Tate pushed off Packers defender [[Sam Shields]], but the officials missed an offensive pass interference penalty call on Tate that would have disallowed the score and ensured a Packers victory.  As pass interference is not reviewable, the replay officials (who were not replacements) could only review the simultaneous catch ruling.  After they upheld the simultaneous possession as a completion in favor of the Seahawks, the controversy surrounding the play led to a plausible disdain from not only irate Packer fans but also NFL fans in general. It was reported that in the hours after the game, the NFL commissioner's office received over 70,000 voice-mails regarding the play. The controversy even drew remarks from people outside of football, as basketball player [[LeBron James]] and professional golfer [[Bubba Watson]] both sent messages via Twitter giving their own criticism on the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Kamal |url=http://www.hlntv.com/article/2012/09/25/referees-nfl-seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers |title=Twitter erupts over NFL replacement refs' call |publisher=[[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]] |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] stated that the season has been "stained in a way that's irreparable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/25/dale-earnhardt-jr-nfl-referees/70001129/1#.UGN6yFJu_qM |title=Junior: NFL season 'stained in way that's irreparable' |work=USA Today |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 NFC Championship===
{{main|2018 NFC Championship Game}}
The 2018 NFC Championship between the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] involved a controversial call in which Rams defender [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]] collided with [[Tommylee Lewis]] of the Saints on a pass from [[Drew Brees]] late in the game. Robey-Coleman was not flagged on the play, but several commentators and Saints fans complained that one should've been thrown for [[pass interference]] on Robey-Coleman. Had the penalty been thrown, the Saints would've been given a fresh set of downs and would've been able to run the clock down to the final seconds to be in position to kick the game-winning field goal. Instead, the Saints kicked the field goal from there to go ahead 23–20 with a little under two minutes to go. The Rams kicked a field goal to tie the game in regulation time and send it into overtime, where they would win 26–23 on another field goal following a Brees interception. After the game, the NFL came under fire for its rule surrounding pass interference penalties, with some commentators calling the no-call among the worst in league history.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The day after the game, an online petition was filed by Saints fans to convince the NFL to replay the final couple of minutes because of the incident. Another day later, the Saints filed a lawsuit against the NFL due to the call. Many outlets dubbed the call the worst of the 2018 season and amongst the worst in football history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/20/18190982/saints-rams-nfc-championship-game-missed-pass-interference-nickell-robey-coleman-tommylee-lewis|title=Ball Does Lie: The Saints Just Lost on the Worst Missed Call in NFL Playoff History|last=Heifetz|first=Danny|date=2019-01-20|website=The Ringer|access-date=2019-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.profootballweekly.com/2019/01/21/missed-pi-might-have-been-worst-non-call-ever-but-will-nfl-change-replay-because-of-it/apmrsag/|title=Missed PI might have been worst non-call ever, but will NFL change replay because of it?|last=Edholm|first=Eric|website=www.profootballweekly.com|access-date=2019-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All arguments about the call fell on deaf ears, and the Rams went on to the Super Bowl, where they lost 13-3 to the New England Patriots. In 2019, the NFL made pass interference calls challengeable for head coaches.

==Deflategate==
{{Main|Deflategate}}
On January 18, 2015, the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 45-7 in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. Prior to and during the game, the Colts accused the Patriots of underinflating their footballs. Following a five-month investigation, the NFL announced on May 11, 2015 that quarterback [[Tom Brady]] would be suspended without pay for four games of the [[2015 NFL season|upcoming NFL season]] for more probably than not being generally aware that someone possibly deflated some of the balls after the referee tested them.  The rules at the time called for a warning to be issued and a possible fine for this infraction.  If a player continued, after being warned, to break this rule during the game, the player was to be thrown out of the game. The Patriots were also fined $1 million and forfeited their first round selection in the [[2016 NFL draft]] and their fourth round selection in the 2017 NFL draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000492185/article/brady-suspended-4-games-patriots-forfeit-2016-first-rounder|title=Patriots' Tom Brady suspended 4 games|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Football League"&gt;{{cite web|title= NFL releases statement on Patriots' violations|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000492190/article/nfl-releases-statement-on-patriots-violations|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2015, the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA) filed an appeal of Brady's four-game suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12887452/nflpa-appeals-four-game-suspension-new-england-patriots-quarterback-tom-brady|title=NFLPA appeals Patriots QB Tom Brady's four-game suspension|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2015, the NFL announced the upholding of Brady's four-game suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|title=Roger Goodell upholds Tom Brady suspension|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000504258/article/roger-goodell-upholds-tom-brady-suspension|publisher=National Football League|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] upheld the suspension in an internal appeal, a federal court case on the matter was started. On September 3, 2015, Judge [[Richard M. Berman]] ruled to vacate Goodell's four game suspension of Brady, due to absence of "...the requisites of fairness and due process."&lt;ref name="JudgeNullifiesBradySuspension"&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Conor|title=Judge nullifies Tom Brady's four-game suspension|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000520618/article/judge-nullifies-tom-bradys-fourgame-suspension|publisher=National Football League|date=September 3, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 25, 2016, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] overturned Judge Berman's decision to vacate Brady's suspension by a 2-1 majority.&lt;ref name="BermanOverturned"&gt;{{cite web|last=Belson|first=Ken|title=N.F.L.

==National Football League on television==
The NFL's status as a prime offering by the networks has led some to conclude that unbiased coverage of the league is not possible, although this may be true of most sports. However, with the current [[concentration of media ownership]] in the U.S., the league essentially has broadcast contracts with four media companies ([[CBS Corporation]], [[NBCUniversal]], Fox's parent company [[Fox Corporation]], and ESPN's parent company [[The Walt Disney Company]]) that own a combined vast majority of the American broadcast and cable networks.

===ESPN===
In 2011, ESPN agreed to a deal with the NFL worth more than $15 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/sports/football/espn-extends-deal-with-nfl-for-15-billion.html|title=ESPN Extends Deal With N.F.L. for $15.2 Billion|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|date=8 September 2011|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact led several media organizations, including ''[[Forbes]]'', to argue whether the financial relationship with the league creates a conflict of interest when ESPN covers the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2015/08/25/espns-uncomfortable-unnerving-relationship-with-the-nfl/#5b6225251ff2|title=ESPN's Uncomfortable, Unnerving Relationship With The NFL|first=Maury|last=Brown|work=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, ESPN attempted to run a dramatic series showing steamier aspects of pro football, ''[[Playmakers]]'', but canceled the series after the league reportedly threatened to exclude the network from the next set of TV contracts. The network also withdrew its partnership with the [[PBS]] series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' on the 2013 documentary "[[League of Denial]]", which chronicles the history of head injuries in the NFL, shortly after a meeting between ESPN executives and league commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] took place in New York City, though ESPN denies pressure from the NFL led to its backing out of the project, claiming a lack of editorial control instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/sports/football/nfl-pressure-said-to-prompt-espn-to-quit-film-project.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=N.F.L.

Then in July 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that sources within ESPN believed that the NFL gave them a "terrible" 2015 ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' schedule as "payback" for remarks made on air by both ESPN commentators [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Bill Simmons]] that were critical of the league and Goodell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-wants-keith-olbermann-quit-806220 |title=ESPN Wants Keith Olbermann to Quit Doing "Commentary" |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2015-07-01| accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN parted ways with both Olbermann and Simmons during that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/07/09/did-the-nfl-punish-espn-with-bad-monday-night-football-games/ |title=Did the NFL punish ESPN with bad 'Monday Night Football' games? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2015-07-09| accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 NFL ratings===

The NFL has been a long-standing powerhouse in the television and advertising marketplace, but since about the beginning of the 2016 season, the NFL's ratings have begun to drop. Speculation about the unexpected rating drops covers a myriad of possibilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL memo cites multiple reasons for TV ratings drop in 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17738537/nfl-memo-cites-multiple-reasons-tv-ratings-drop-2016|website=ESPN|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

=== Increased Penalties and Ratings ===
The NFL has seen a vast increase in penalties called per game and total penalty yards per game. From 2009 to 2016 penalties per game increased by 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://247sports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/Bolt/NFLs-penalty-count-up-more-than-20-percent-since-2009-48360555/|title=NFL's penalty count up more than 20 percent since 2009|work=Dallas Cowboys|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through week 1 of the 2018 regular season, penalties are up another 19 percent vs 2017.&lt;ref name="Beaton"/&gt; Week one of the 2018 NFL season saw the second-most accepted penalties called of any single week in the past 10 years with 255 called, an increase of 35% per game from the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2018/9/12/17842576/week-1-of-2018-set-a-new-nfl-record-for-penalties-in-a-week-steelers-browns-al-riveron-news|title=Week 1 of 2018 set a new NFL record for penalties in a week|work=Behind the Steel Curtain|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints about increased changes in the rulebook making the rules too convoluted to understand and reducing the perceived quality of competition have colored the media surrounding the 2018 NFL season particularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/sports/nfl-week-1-tackling-rule.html|title=The N.F.L.

Players in the [[National Football League]] wear [[Uniform number (American football)|uniform numbers]] between 1 and 99, and no two players on a team may wear the same number on the field at the same time.  Rules exist which tie a player's number to a specific range of numbers for their primary [[American football positions|position]].  Additionally, rules exist which limit who may handle the ball on [[Offense (sports)|offense]], generally players who are designated as [[offensive lineman]], who wear numbers 50-79, are not allowed to handle the ball during a [[play from scrimmage]], though they are allowed to do so if they report to the referee as playing out of position.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}
===Prior to 1973===

The earliest numbering systems were significantly different from the modern variation. Until the 1920s, when the NFL limited its rosters to 22 players, it was rare to see player numbers much higher than 25 ([[Red Grange]] was a notable exception, wearing 77 with the [[Chicago Bears]] while playing [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], which would not be allowed under current NFL rules), and numbers had little correlation with positions (in 1929, the [[Orange/Newark Tornadoes|Orange Tornadoes]] subverted the system even further, experimenting with using [[Latin alphabet|letters]] instead of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~maxymuk/home/ongoing/orange.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

The numbering system used today originated in football's past when all teams employed some variation of the [[single wing]] formation on offense. When teams switched to the [[T-formation]] in the 1930s and 1940s, the numbers were taken with them to whatever position evolved from the old single wing position.  This numbering system originated in college football and was used only informally in the NFL until 1952; the backs were given numbers in the 10–49 range and the offensive line numbers in the 50–89 range.  Earlier, defensive players wore numbers that reflected their offensive position, as many players played both offense and defense. For example, quarterbacks and halfbacks usually played in the defensive back field and so had numbers in the 10–49 range, defensive line numbers ranged from 50–89, while linebackers (who often played fullback or tight end on offense) could have just about any number.  Split ends (precursors to modern wide receivers) had numbers in the 80s, and many would play corner back (i.e. [[Night Train Lane]], who wore 81 as a cornerback).{{cn|date=May 2019}}

The [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] of the 1940s, which would later merge with the NFL, had a different numbering system with quarterback in the 60s ([[Otto Graham]]), fullbacks in the 70s ([[Marion Motley]]), halfbacks in the 80s, ends in the 50s ([[Mac Speedie]]), tackles in the 40s ([[Lou Groza]]), guards in the 30s, and centers in the 20s.  When the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, the AAFC players kept their old uniform numbers which caused confusion and resulted in the NFL going to a standard numbering system in 1952.  This resulted in many star players having to change their numbers in mid-career.  Examples are [[Otto Graham]] going from 60 to 14, [[Norm Van Brocklin]] going from 25 to 11, and [[Tom Fears]] going from 55 to 80.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The [[American Football League]] of the 1960s, which would also later merge with the NFL, mostly used the same numbering system as the NFL did, with some exceptions, mostly pertaining to wide receivers, who were allowed to wear numbers in the teens and 20s (as the AFL had a greater priority toward offense, the league often made use of flankers, receivers positioned in the backfield). The AFL's numbering system also allowed for the use of a double-zero as a number, which was used by future Hall of Famer [[Jim Otto]], center for the [[Oakland Raiders]]; after wearing the number 50 in his rookie season, switched to 00 which he wore for the remainder of his career.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

===1973 standardization===
The NFL imposed a more rigid numbering system in 1973.  When it went into effect, players who played in the league before then were given a [[grandfather clause]] to continue wearing newly prohibited numbers. [[New England Patriots]] [[defensive end]] [[Julius Adams]] was the last player to be covered by the clause, wearing number 85 through the [[1985 New England Patriots season|1985 season]], but he had to wear number 69 when he briefly came out of retirement in 1987 during the [[1987 NFL strike|1987 strike]].  The 1973 system is still in place today, though some changes have been made periodically since then as team rosters have grown and as greater flexibility has been needed to deal with changing roster demands.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

===Post-1973 changes===
Since 1973, only five major changes have been made. In 1979, the NFL allowed defensive linemen to wear numbers 90 to 99 and centers 60-79.{{cn|date=May 2019}} In 1984, the NFL allowed linebackers to wear jersey numbers in the 90–99 range, since more teams were making use of the [[3–4 defense]] and thus were quickly exhausting numbers for linebackers, who previously were only allowed to wear numbers in the 50–59 range.{{cn|date=May 2019}} Another change occurred in 2004, when the NFL allowed wide receivers to wear numbers 10–19 in addition to the 80–89 range; this was due to several NFL teams retiring 80-range numbers, as well as teams employing more receivers and tight ends in their offense.{{cn|date=May 2019}}  Since 2010, defensive linemen are allowed to wear numbers 50-59; this is in part because of the interchangeability of linebackers and defensive ends (a defensive end in a [[4-3 defense]] would be an outside linebacker in a 3-4). In 2015, the NFL Competition Committee approved linebackers using numbers from 40 to 49.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/25/nfl-passes-brian-bosworth-rule-linebackers-can-now-wear-jerseys-numbered-40-49/ NFL passes “Brian Bosworth rule,” linebackers can now wear jerseys numbered 40-49] ''[[Profootballtalk.com]]'' (03/25/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current system==
The NFL's current numbering system is as follows:&lt;ref name="rulebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://operations.nfl.com/media/3277/2018-nfl-rulebook_final-version.pdf|title=2018 NFL Rules|author=|date=|website=operations.nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers used relate to the player's primary position when they are first assigned a number.  If they later change positions, they can keep their prior number, unless it conflicts with the eligible receiver rule; that is only players that change positions from an eligible position (such as receiver or back) to an ineligible position (such as an offensive lineman) are required to change numbers if they change position.  Additionally, during a game a player may play out-of-position, but only after reporting in to the referees, who will announce to the stadium that a specific player number has reported in (for example "Number 61 has reported as an eligible receiver") to alert the opposing team, other officials, and the audience that a player is legally out-of-position.  A 2015 rule clarification made it illegal to use unusual formations (such as a tackle split wide in the slot position, but still "covered" by a wide receiver) to obscure who is and is not eligible based on uniform numbers in order to avoid having to report ineligible numbers.

Some positions are not listed in the rule book, such as [[long snapper]] and special teams [[Gunner (American football)|gunner]].  Teams often assign these players to a recognized position (such as long snappers being listed as [[tight end]]s or special teams gunners as [[wide receiver]]s) even if those players rarely, if ever, play in their official position.  The rule book also allows players to appeal for exemptions to the numbering rules directly to the commissioner's office, which may grant such exceptions on occasion.

==Retired numbers==
{{main|List of National Football League retired numbers}}
Many NFL teams have retired some numbers in honor of the team's best players. Generally when a number is retired, future players for the team may not wear it.  The NFL officially discourages (but does not prevent) teams from retiring numbers, as the limited number of uniform numbers available for each position can be depleted.  Some teams will hold official "number retirement" ceremonies, others have "informally" retired numbers by simply not issuing them.  For teams that do not retire uniform numbers, they often honor players in other ways, such as team halls of fame or the like.

==Numbers 0 and 00==
Numbers 0 and 00 are no longer used, though they were issued in the NFL before the number standardization in 1973. Quarterback [[Johnny Clement]], running back [[Johnny Olszewski]] and safety [[Obert Logan]] all wore a single-0 jersey in the NFL. Author [[George Plimpton]] famously wore 0 during a brief preseason stint at [[quarterback]] for the [[Detroit Lions]]. [[Jim Otto]] wore number "00" during most of his career with the [[Oakland Raiders]] as a play on his name, "aught-oh." Wide receiver [[Ken Burrough]] of the [[Houston Oilers]] also wore "00" during his NFL career in the 1970s. More recently, linebacker [[Bryan Cox]] wore 0 in the 2001 preseason with the [[New England Patriots]]; for the regular season, he switched to 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/sports/patriots-notebook-newcomer-cox-has-his-eyes-on-uniform-no/article_ec00ee5b-5cd6-5209-ab88-9fb2f939b179.html|title=Patriots' Notebook: Newcomer Cox has his eyes on uniform No. 51|first=Mark|last=Farinella|publisher=The Sun Chronicle|date=August 2, 2001|access-date=February 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from 01 to 09, with a leading "0" digit, would theoretically be allowed (and be considered the same as numbers 1 to 9 for record-keeping purposes), but such a number has never been issued in professional football.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1606">The '''[[National Football League]] Competition Committee''' was created in 1968 following the announcement of the [[AFL-NFL merger]].  It replaced the NFL Rules Committee, which was formed in 1932 when the NFL adopted its own rulebook.  Prior to 1932 the NFL used the college rulebook.  

Members of the Competition Committee are chosen by the [[NFL commissioner]].

The '''NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement''' ('''CBA''') is a [[labour law|labor agreement]] which reflects the results of collective bargaining negotiations between the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA) and [[National Football League]] (NFL) team owners. The labor agreement classifies distribution of league revenues, sets health and safety standards and establishes benefits, including pensions and medical benefits, for all players in the NFL.  The first collective bargaining agreement was reached in 1968 after player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike to increase salaries, pensions and benefits for all players in the league. Later negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement called for injury grievances, a guaranteed percentage of revenues for players, an expansion of [[free agent|free agency]] and other issues impacting the business of the NFL. The NFLPA and team owners have negotiated seven different agreements since 1968.

Most recently, in 2011, players and team owners reached a collective bargaining agreement after a player [[2011 NFL lockout|lockout]] and court-ordered mediation. The currently active agreement was ratified in 2011 and extends through the 2020 season, and includes changes to league revenue distribution, increases in player benefits and health and safety improvements including major limits on offseason, preseason and regular season practice activities.

==1968 agreement==
In 1968 the National Football League Players Association was first recognized in writing by National Football League team owners. This occurred after the player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike, intending to pressure owners to increase minimum salaries, pensions and other [[Employee benefits|benefits]] for all players.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[List of NFL franchise owners|NFL team owners]] locked out the players who were on strike.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eleven days of work stoppage, the first [[collective bargaining]] agreement (CBA) was reached between the NFL and the NFLPA.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothschild11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/07/26/labor-scorecard |title=Players vs. owners: Who came out on top in major labor disputes? |author=Richard Rothschild |date=July 26, 2011 |work=si.com |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement set a minimum salary of $9,000 per year for rookie players and $10,000 per year for veteran players. It also set aside $1.5 million of league revenue to be contributed to player pensions.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 agreement==
A new agreement was negotiated in 1970 after the NFLPA merged with the American Football League Players Association.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During negotiations over the new CBA, players went on strike in July 1970.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new agreement was reached after four days.&lt;ref name=Rothschild11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/07/26/labor-scorecard |title=Players vs. owners: Who came out on top in major labor disputes? |author=Richard Rothschild |date=July 26, 2011 |work=si.com |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement increased minimum player salaries and altered the league's medical and pension programs.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided for impartial arbitration of injury grievances, which had previously been decided by the [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]].&lt;ref name="NFLhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nflplayers.com/about-us/history/ |title=History |publisher=NFL |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]] was elected as president of the NFLPA during this negotiation,&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new agreement was projected to cover the 1970 through 1973 seasons.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1974 strike==
In 1974, the veteran NFL players went on strike for five weeks, declaring "No Freedom, No Football," but they received no concessions before reporting to [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] after a two-week "cooling off" period.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoArchive"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bills, Bengals' vets won't leave |author=Associated Press |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/08/25/page/65/article/bills-bengals-vets-wont-leave |work=Chicago Tribune |date=August 25, 1974 |accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike never resumed, and the NFLPA player representatives voted instead to pursue a previously filed lawsuit, Mackey v. NFL, which challenged the Rozelle Rule restrictions on free agency as a violation of the [[United States antitrust law|federal antitrust laws]]. The Rozelle Rule was a compensation clause which outlined that a team losing a [[Free agent#National Football League usa|free agent]] would get equal value in return.&lt;ref name=Bell11/&gt; Player confidence in the NFLPA was weakened by the strike's ineffectiveness. By 1975, fewer than half of players in the NFL were paying their [[union dues]].&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1977 agreement==
After players won the Mackey case in court, the NFLPA and the owners settled on a new CBA which implemented a new [[right of first refusal|first refusal]] and compensation system to replace the Rozelle Rule.&lt;ref name=Bell11/&gt; The new system still placed restrictions on players' free agency.&lt;ref name=Quinn12/&gt; The court decision outlined that compensation for [[National Football League draft|draft picks]] was to be awarded on the basis of the salaries received by departing free agents.&lt;ref name=Bell11/&gt; The agreement reached in 1977 significantly improved some medical and pension benefits for players and gained neutral [[arbitration]] of all player/club disputes.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1982 agreement==
In 1982, after playing the first two games of the season, NFL players went on strike again, seeking to attain a guaranteed percentage of club and league revenues.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strike lasted 57 days, making it the longest work stoppage in NFL history until that date.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike ended with a tentative agreement on November 16 which included funds to cover players' lost wages during the work stoppage.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiators signed a new collective bargaining agreement on December 5. The agreement improved players' benefits by implementing a new severance pay benefit, increasing minimum salaries for players in all years of service, and adding new medical rights for players. The agreement also included a revamped season schedule for 1982, which had a nine-game regular season and a new [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]] format which allowed 16 of the league's 28 teams to qualify for the [[Super Bowl|playoffs]].&lt;ref name=Bell11/&gt; Additionally, the agreement included a guarantee from the owners that players would collectively receive at least $1.6 billion in salaries and benefits over the five-year term of the new agreement.&lt;ref name="Lockout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/topics/_/page/nfl-labor-negotiations |title=NFL Lockout |date=December 5, 2012 |work=NFL Topics |publisher=NFL |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1987 strike==
After playing the first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the strike, team owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including [[Joe Montana]], [[Lawrence Taylor]] and [[Tony Dorsett]] crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="NFLhistory"/&gt; But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal [[Norris-Laguardia Act|Norris-LaGuardia Act]] prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes.&lt;ref name="PayDirt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pay Dirt: The Business of Professional Team Sports |author=James P.

In 1989, team owners unilaterally implemented a limited free agency system called "Plan B".&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed teams to continue to impose first refusal and compensation restrictions on their top 37 players.

In November 1989 the [[8th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that team owners were exempt from the federal antitrust laws so long as players were adequately represented by a union.&lt;ref name="Pierson91"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nfl Players Gain in Push For Free Agency |author=Don Pierson |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-05-29/sports/9102170994_1_mcneil-case-nflpa-district-judge-david-doty |work=The Chicago Tribune |date=May 29, 1991 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the NFLPA decertified as a union, stating its union status provided more protection for the owners than for the players.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL continued to operate without a collective bargaining agreement until 1993.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1993 agreement==
The NFL and its players began negotiations after players won the [[Freeman McNeil]] legal case brought against Plan B. The jury decided on September 10, 1992 that Plan B was too restrictive under federal antitrust laws. Subsequently, team owners agreed to discuss free agency for all players.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFLPA filed a class action suit in the name of [[Reggie White]], claiming that all players in the NFL should receive money damages as a result of the illegality of Plan B. The settlement provided for payment of almost $200 million in damages, and was contingent upon the NFLPA re-forming as a union and signing a new CBA which would incorporate the terms of the litigation settlement.&lt;ref name="Loyola94"&gt;{{cite journal |title=White v.

In return, the NFLPA agreed to a salary cap based upon an agreed percentage of revenues.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement had an immediate impact on player salaries, increasing wages for the 1993 season by 38 percent.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBA agreed to in 1993 was extended by the agreement of players and owners in 1998. This lasted until the 2002 season, when the CBA was extended through the 2006 season.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 agreement==
The CBA agreed upon in 1993 was extended again in 2006 after the team owners agreed to include more revenues in the salary cap and to increase benefits, including the first ever plan to provide funds to players for medical expenses after their post-career medical insurance ran out.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension of the CBA included an option for either party to opt out before November 8, 2008, which would have resulted in a termination of the CBA on March 1, 2011 if either side chose to exercise it.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team owners voted unanimously to opt out in May 2008.&lt;ref name=Quinn12&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Kevin G. |year=2010 |title=Getting to the 2011-2020 National Football League Collective Bargaining Agreement |journal=International Journal of Sport Finance |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2680466081 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 agreement==
Negotiations for a new CBA began in early 2010. Team owners and new NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] demanded a cutback in salaries and benefits under the cap system, promising to lockout the players if no new agreement was reached by March 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="ESPN11.2"&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL locks out players, who file suit |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6205936 |work=ESPN.com |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFLPA rejected Goodell’s proposal, requesting to see all league and club financial records to determine what need, if any, the clubs had for a decrease in player costs. The players voted during their 2010 team meetings to end the NFLPA’s status as a labor union as of March 1, 2011, unless a new CBA was reached by that time.&lt;ref name="ESPNM11"&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL players ask judge for $707M |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6533458 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no salary cap in 2010, free agency activity and overall expenditures on players declined, leading the NFLPA to file a collusion case, claiming that the owners had unlawfully agreed to reduce competition for free agents.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to make any progress in negotiations, both sides accepted mediation under the auspices of the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (United States)|Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]] (FMCS) in February 2011. During mediation, players and owners agreed to extend the 2006 CBA by one week. The FMCS failed to mediate a settlement and the previous CBA expired on March 7, 2011. That same day, the NFLPA announced it was no longer a union. This allowed players to file individual antitrust cases, many of which challenged the legality of the impending lockout.&lt;ref name="Farmer11"&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL players decertify their union |author=Sam Farmer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/11/sports/la-sp-nfl-labor-talks-fail |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Brady]] of the [[New England Patriots]] and [[Peyton Manning]] of the [[Indianapolis Colts]] were two of the eight named plaintiffs in the action filed in [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota|Federal District Court in Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="Mone11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Brady, NFLPA sued by retired players |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-brady-nflpa-sued-by-retired-players/ |work=CBS News |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFLWire2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten players named as plaintiffs in antitrust lawsuit vs. NFL |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81eb9269/article/ten-players-named-as-plaintiffs-in-antitrust-lawsuit-vs-nfl |work=NFL Wire Reports |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal District Court initially ruled for the players, declaring the lockout illegal because the players were no longer members of a union.&lt;ref name=Quinn12/&gt; The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the District Court's ruling, and the lockout continued pending a final determination in the appellate court.&lt;ref name=Quinn12/&gt; In July 2011, as court-ordered mediation continued between players and owners in New York, at the offices of the NFL’s lawyers, the 8th Circuit court announced that the Norris–La Guardia Act prohibited it from enjoining the lockout. The court stated in its decision that the ruling only applied to veteran players under contract, and not to unsigned rookies or veteran free agents.&lt;ref name="Mihoces11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Appeals court backs NFL as lockout remains in place |author=Gary Mihoces |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-05-16-lockout-stay_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months of negotiations, the longest lockout in league history ended on July 25, 2011 following a tentative litigation settlement which reclassified some league revenues for cap purposes. This settlement allowed team owners to keep a small percentage from being included in future salary caps.&lt;ref name="Clayton11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Roger Goodell: 'Football is back' |author=John Clayton |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6799301/nflpa-oks-deal-roger-goodell-says-football-back |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was conditional upon the NFLPA re-constituting as a union and incorporating the settlement terms into a new CBA.&lt;ref name=Fendrich11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/25/nfl-lockout-over-owners-players-agree-deal_n_908408.html |title=NFL Lockout Over: Owners, Players Agree To Deal |author=Howard Fendrich |date=July 25, 2011 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6834391/nfl-players-ratify-collective-bargaining-agreement-which-includes-hgh-testing-sources-say |title=NFL players ratify new CBA  |date=August 5, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players reported to training camps in July 2011, and voted to re-constitute the NFLPA as a union.

The key features of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including a reduction in the number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “[[Two-A-Days (football)|two-a days]]", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season.&lt;ref name="CBA11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://images.nflplayers.com/mediaResources/files/2011CBA.pdf |title=Collective Bargaining Agreement |author=NFLPA |date=August 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/07/reports-nfl-players-agree-to-new-collective-bargaining-agreement/1#.U9KAwPldW_g |title=NFL, players announce new 10-year labor agreement |author=Nate Davis |date=July 25, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new CBA also featured increases in player benefits, including retroactive pension increases for retired players and the creation of a neuro-cognitive benefit for players affected by concussions and other similar injuries.

The '''National Football League''' ('''NFL''') is a professional [[American football]] [[Sports league|league]] consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). The NFL is one of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports Capitalism: The Foreign Business of American Professional Leagues|first=Frank P.|last=Jozsa| publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2004| isbn=978-0-7546-4185-8|page=270|quote=Since 1922, [the NFL] has been the top professional sports league in the world with respect to American football}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL's [[National Football League regular season|17-week regular season]] runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one [[Bye (sports)#Gridiron football and Major League Baseball|bye week]]. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]], a [[single-elimination tournament]] culminating in the [[Super Bowl]], which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the '''American Professional Football Association''' ('''APFA''') before renaming itself the National Football League for the [[1922 NFL season|1922 season]]. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the [[History of the National Football League championship#1933–1966: NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] until 1966. Following [[AFL–NFL merger|an agreement to merge]] the NFL with the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970.

The [[Green Bay Packers]] hold the most combined NFL championships with 13, winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards. Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[New England Patriots]] both have the most championship titles at six. The Patriots are the NFL's current champions following their victory over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in [[Super Bowl LIII]].

===Founding and history===
On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the [[Akron Pros]], [[Canton Bulldogs]], [[Cleveland Tigers (NFL)|Cleveland Indians]], and [[Dayton Triangles]] at the Jordan and [[Hupmobile]] auto showroom in [[Canton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="profootballhof.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/nfl-founded-in-canton/|title=NFL founded in Canton - Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com|access-date=February 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306152757/http://www.profootballhof.com/news/nfl-founded-in-canton/|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the ''Canton Evening Repository'', intended to "raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules".&lt;ref name="Happy Birthday NFL?" /&gt;

Another meeting was held on September 17, 1920 with representatives from teams from four states: Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton from Ohio; the [[Hammond Pros]] and [[Muncie Flyers]] from Indiana; the [[Rochester Jeffersons]] from New York; and the [[Rock Island Independents]], [[Chicago Bears|Decatur Staleys]], and [[Arizona Cardinals|Racine (Chicago) Cardinals]] from Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/history-of-football/1869-1939/1920-american-professional-football-conference-is-formed/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915042600/http://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/history-of-football/1869-1939/1920-american-professional-football-conference-is-formed/ |archive-date=September 15, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The league was renamed to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).&lt;ref name="Happy Birthday NFL?"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1980 |title=Happy Birthday NFL? |journal=The Coffin Corner |publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-08-038.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206155110/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-08-038.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The league elected [[Jim Thorpe]] as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams (the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo All-Americans]], [[Chicago Tigers]], [[Columbus Panhandles]], and [[Detroit (1920s NFL teams)|Detroit Heralds]] joined the league during the year).

In [[1932 NFL season|1932]], the season ended with the Chicago Bears ({{win loss record|w=6|l=1|t=6}}) and the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] ({{win loss record|w=6|l=1|t=4}}) tied for first in the league standings.&lt;ref name="1925–1937"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=Past Standings | website=National Football League | page=26 | accessdate=February 21, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140347/http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | archive-date=September 4, 2012 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest [[winning percentage]] (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|playoff game]] between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to [[Chicago Stadium]], which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ''de facto'' championship game led the NFL, beginning in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], to split into [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933–69|two divisions]] with a championship game to be played between the division champions.&lt;ref name="The 60-Yard Circus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929180027/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2010|title=The 60-Yard Circus|last=Carroll|first=Bob|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1934 NFL season|1934 season]] also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were [[Black players in professional American football|absent from the league]].

The NFL was always the foremost professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]] and the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the [[Los Angeles Rams]] (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional [[Canadian football]] circuit, which formally became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|a different football code]] than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.

A new professional league, the fourth [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a [[AFL–NFL merger|merger]] on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the [[Super Bowl]], was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], and the AFL winning [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV]].&lt;ref name="Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044251/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 15, 2001 |title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger |last=Cross |first=B. Duane |date=January 22, 2001 |publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated|CNNSI]] |accessdate=February 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.&lt;ref name="History: 1961–1970" /&gt;

Today, the NFL is considered{{clarify|date=June 2017}} the most popular sports league in North America; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million global viewers watched 1989's [[Super Bowl XXIII]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies" /&gt; The NFL established [[National Football League Properties|NFL Properties]] in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of [[NFL Charities]] and a national partnership with [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies|editor1=Bartlett, Roger|editor2=Gratton, Chris|editor3=Rolf, Christer|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=October 26, 2009|pages=932–933|isbn=978-0415561471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6CaJM_BXR0C&amp;pg=PA933&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+NFL&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZmrEUfG7O4XN0wGN5IGIAw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclopedia%20NFL&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930214904/http://books.google.com/books?id=t6CaJM_BXR0C&amp;pg=PA933&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+NFL&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZmrEUfG7O4XN0wGN5IGIAw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclopedia%20NFL&amp;f=false|archive-date=September 30, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Tagliabue]] was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his seventeen-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams,&lt;ref name="The Legacy of Tagliabue?"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/the-legacy-of-tagliabue/|title=The Legacy of Tagliabue?|last=Evans|first=Thayer|date=February 2, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204152623/http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/the-legacy-of-tagliabue/|archive-date=December 4, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles.&lt;ref name="Report Card: Tagliabue's legacy includes new model for racial hiring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=lapchick_richard&amp;id=2552322|title=Report Card: Tagliabue's legacy includes new model for racial hiring|last=Lapchick|first=Richard|date=August 17, 2006|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925184203/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=lapchick_richard&amp;id=2552322|archive-date=September 25, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's current Commissioner, [[Roger Goodell]], has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules.&lt;ref name="Roger Goodell's authority takes a hit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Roger Goodell's authority takes a hit|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/8741639/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-invulnerable-authority-takes-hit-overturned-suspensions|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216064817/http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/8741639/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-invulnerable-authority-takes-hit-overturned-suspensions|archive-date=December 16, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce [[concussion]]s and improve player safety.&lt;ref name="Violent hits keep coming, so is NFL changing culture?"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brady|first=Erik|title=Violent hits keep coming, so is NFL changing culture?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/09/16/malcom-floyd-brandon-meriwaether-concussions-suspended/2823717/|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=September 22, 2013|author2=Gary Mihoces|date=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921090222/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/09/16/malcom-floyd-brandon-meriwaether-concussions-suspended/2823717/|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season and playoff development===
{{Main|List of National Football League seasons}}
From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in [[1935 NFL season|1935]], later shortening this to 11 games in [[1937 NFL season|1937]] and 10 games in [[1943 NFL season|1943]], mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in [[1946 NFL season|1946]] and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]].&lt;ref name="NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1348|title=NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512202615/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1348|archive-date=May 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA).&lt;ref name=meaningless/&gt;

The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to [[1966 NFL season|1966]], where the champions of each conference would meet in the [[History of the National Football League championship#1933–1966: NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]]. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the conference champion. In [[1967 NFL season|1967]], the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the [[NFL playoffs]], a two-round playoff.&lt;ref name="Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/lady-luck-and-the-lombardi-legend/4897/|title=Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend|date=October 12, 2005|publisher=Cold Hard Football Facts.

Effectively a [[third place playoff|third-place game]], pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been [[exhibition game|exhibitions]] rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.&lt;ref name="This Day in Browns History – Jan. 7"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Steve|title=This Day in Browns History – Jan. 7|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=January 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082936/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|archive-date=January 11, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,&lt;ref name="History: 1961–1970"&gt;{{cite web|title=History: 1961–1970|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222163233/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970|archive-date=December 22, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; would also feature an expanded eight-team playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in [[1990 NFL season|1990]] to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.&lt;ref name="History of the Wild Card"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.aspx?story_id=1940|title=History of the Wild Card|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103185059/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.aspx?story_id=1940|archive-date=January 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] labeled it a "distraction", saying "the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business." As a result, the league office might owe around US$10&amp;nbsp;million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.&lt;ref name="NFL no longer non-profit after giving up tax exempt status"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Gary|title=NFL no longer non-profit after giving up tax exempt status|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/nfl-no-longer-non-profit-giving-tax-exempt-status-article-1.2202484|website=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=June 25, 2015|date=April 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618033221/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/nfl-no-longer-non-profit-giving-tax-exempt-status-article-1.2202484|archive-date=June 18, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one defined officer, the president, which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties (such as awarding the conference championship trophy).

The commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of two-thirds or 18 (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or ten of the conference members.&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 26–27"&gt;NFL Bylaws, p. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the "principal [[executive officer]]"&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /&gt; of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league bylaws or committed "conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football".&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /&gt; The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /&gt;

In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's Executive Committee up to and including the "cancellation or forfeiture"&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35" /&gt; of a club's franchise or any other action he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games.&lt;ref name="NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35"&gt;NFL Bylaws, p. 28–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after [[Paul Tagliabue]], the previous commissioner, retired.&lt;ref name="Owners Pick Goodell as NFL Commissioner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080801043.html|title=Owners Pick Goodell as NFL Commissioner|last=Maske|first=Mark|date=August 9, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112005402/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080801043.html|archive-date=November 12, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financials===
NFL revenue is from three primary sources: NFL Ventures (merchandising), NFL Enterprises (NFL Network and NFL Sunday Ticket, which the league controls), and the television contract. The league distributes such revenue equally among teams, regardless of performance. {{asof|2019|2}} each team receives $255 million annually from the league's television contract, up 150% from $99.9 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="kcs20190206"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article225279155.html |title=Kansas City Chiefs’ tax returns provide rare look inside the business of pro football |last=Hendricks |first=Mike |date=2019-02-06 |work=The Kansas City Star |access-date=2019-02-10 |last2=Vockrodt |first2=Steve |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212070621/https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article225279155.html |archive-date=February 12, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most NFL teams' financial statements are secret. ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' obtained the Kansas City Chiefs' tax returns for 2008–2010. According to the ''Star'', the team's revenue rose from $231 million in 2008 to $302 million in 2010. In 2010, two thirds of revenue came from the league: $99.8 million from NFL Ventures ($55.3 million) and NFL Enterprises ($44.6 million), and the $99.9 million share of the television contract. The remaining one third was from tickets ($42.4 million), corporate sponsorships ($6.6 million), food sales ($5 million), parking passes ($4.7 million), in-stadium advertising ($3.7 million), radio contract ($2.7 million), and miscellaneous sources.{{r|kcs20190206}}

The largest Chiefs expense in 2010 was $148 million for players, coaches, and other employees. Of the $38 million in operating income, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], [[Lamar Hunt Jr.|Lamar Jr.]], two other children, and widow of former team owner [[Lamar Hunt]] divided $17.6 million, and reinvested the remaining $20 million into the team.{{r|kcs20190206}}

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the NFL's revenue model is in contravention of the typical corporate structure. By redistributing profits to all teams the NFL is ensuring that one team will not dominate the league through excessive earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_women_s_movement_economics|title=Economic Update: Women's Movement Economics|publisher=|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222120102/http://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_women_s_movement_economics|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Noll]] described the revenue sharing as the league's "most important structural weakness", however, as there is no disincentive against a team playing badly and the largest cost item, player salaries, is capped.{{r|kcs20190206}}

Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are several exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] only have exclusive rights in their cities and share rights outside of it; and teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York City and Los Angeles) or the same state (e.g. California, Florida, and [[Texas]]) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article IV–Territorial Rights|url=http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/html/careers/pdf/co_.pdf#page=14|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|work=Constitution and By-Laws of the National Football League|date=February 1, 1970|accessdate=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909075157/http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/html/careers/pdf/co_.pdf#page=14|archive-date=September 9, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 32 teams are organized into eight geographic divisions of four teams each. These divisions are further organized into two conferences, the [[National Football Conference]] and the [[American Football Conference]]. The two-conference structure has its origins in a time when major American professional football was organized into two independent leagues, the National Football League and its younger rival, the [[American Football League]]. The leagues [[AFL–NFL merger|merged in the late 1960s]], adopting the older league's name and reorganizing slightly to ensure the same number of teams in both conferences.

This chart of the [[2018 NFL season#Regular season standings|2018 season standings]] displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [[2018 New England Patriots season|Patriots in 2018]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[AFC East]]. Thus, [[2019 New England Patriots season|in 2019]], the Patriots will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[AFC North]] and [[NFC East]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[AFC South]] and [[AFC West]] (highlighted in orange).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=NFL|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140017/http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|archive-date=September 4, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league runs a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season. Since 2001, the season has begun the week after Labor Day (first Monday in September) and concluded the week after Christmas.&lt;ref name="Ghost of Christmas past: Sports-free TV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-12-25/news/0512250385_1_christmas-nba-finals-bulls-and-pistons|title=Ghost of Christmas past: Sports-free TV|last=Issacson|first=Melissa|date=December 25, 2005|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513051139/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-12-25/news/0512250385_1_christmas-nba-finals-bulls-and-pistons|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening game of the season is normally a home game on a Thursday for the league's defending champion.&lt;ref name="2012 NFL Schedule Announced" /&gt;

Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the third Friday in December. While Saturday games late in the season are common, the league rarely holds Friday games, the most recent one being on Christmas Day in 2009.&lt;ref name="Sports Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsAcademicPrograms/sportslaw_index.aspx?id=16201|title=Sports Law|last=Sensei|first=Andrew|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925221825/http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsAcademicPrograms/sportslaw_index.aspx?id=16201|archivedate=September 25, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used twice since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard, and in 2012, when the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff game]] was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the [[2012 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name="Blizzard forces postponement of Vikes-Eagles game to Tuesday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blizzard forces postponement of Vikes-Eagles game to Tuesday|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d32bae/article/blizzard-forces-postponement-of-vikeseagles-game-to-tuesday|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=December 26, 2010|accessdate=February 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129141827/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d32bae/article/blizzard-forces-postponement-of-vikeseagles-game-to-tuesday|archive-date=January 29, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFL season opener to be held Wednesday, Sept. 5"&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL season opener to be held Wednesday, Sept. 5|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82746aa5/article/nfl-season-opener-to-be-held-wednesday-sept-5|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017142310/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82746aa5/article/nfl-season-opener-to-be-held-wednesday-sept-5|archive-date=October 17, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents – two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference.&lt;ref name="Realignment for 2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=Realignment for 2002|url=http://www.nfl.com/standings/divisionrealignment|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226050834/http://www.nfl.com/standings/divisionrealignment|archive-date=December 26, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play any games.&lt;ref name="Unusual bye format traces to lockout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/08/unusual-bye-format-traces-to-lockout/|title=Unusual bye format traces to lockout|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=November 8, 2011|publisher=[[Pro Football Talk]].

Although a team's home and away opponents are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates and times for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered "playable schedules" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try to ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.&lt;ref name="NFL schedule navigated World Series, other conflicts "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2010/04/20100426/This-Weeks-News/NFL-Schedule-Navigated-World-Series-Other-Conflicts.aspx|title=NFL schedule navigated World Series, other conflicts|last=Ourand|first=John|date=April 26, 2010|publisher=[[Sports Business Daily]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926154549/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2010/04/20100426/This-Weeks-News/NFL-Schedule-Navigated-World-Series-Other-Conflicts.aspx|archivedate=September 26, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postseason===
{{Main|NFL playoffs|Pro Bowl|Super Bowl}}
[[File:NFL playoff tree.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The seeding bracket for the NFL playoffs]]
Following the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a twelve-team single elimination tournament, is then held. Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams.&lt;ref name="Tie-breaking procedures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tie-breaking procedures|url=http://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|accessdate=February 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131143801/http://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures|archive-date=January 31, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 3–6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.

The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the [[Pro Bowl]], the league's [[all-star game]]. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the [[Super Bowl]]; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.&lt;ref name="Pro Bowl set for Jan. 27 in Honolulu, week before Super Bowl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Bowl set for Jan. 27 in Honolulu, week before Super Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8297274d/article/pro-bowl-set-for-jan-27-in-honolulu-week-before-super-bowl|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702110656/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8297274d/article/pro-bowl-set-for-jan-27-in-honolulu-week-before-super-bowl|archive-date=July 2, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game. The Pro Bowl is not considered as competitive as a regular-season game because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NFC reels in five picks to throttle AFC in Pro Bowl|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=310130032|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=ESPN.com|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105054321/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=310130032|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trophies and awards==

===Team trophies===
{{Main|Vince Lombardi Trophy|Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy|Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup}}
The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the [[Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup]], was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation]]. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a "silver loving cup", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name="Local history: Searching for lost trophy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.com/news/searching-for-lost-trophy-1.204246|title=Local history: Searching for lost trophy|last=Price|first=Mark J.|date=April 25, 2011|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702061827/http://www.ohio.com/news/searching-for-lost-trophy-1.204246|archive-date=July 2, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second trophy, the [[Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy]], was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1967. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, long thought to be lost,&lt;ref name="Inside Redskins Park: The Other Championship Trophy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redskinsblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/inside-redskins-park-the-other-championship-trophy/|title=Inside Redskins Park: The Other Championship Trophy|last=Terl|first=Matt|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Official Redskins Blog|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118083451/http://redskinsblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/inside-redskins-park-the-other-championship-trophy/|archive-date=November 18, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be possessed by the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christi|first=Cliff|title=The mystery of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy|url=http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-cliffs-notes/article-1/The-mystery-of-the-Ed-Thorp-Memorial-Trophy/69ec5eb4-a138-453f-84db-ec0ee40f1cb0|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Packers.com|date=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128174924/https://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-cliffs-notes/article-1/The-mystery-of-the-Ed-Thorp-Memorial-Trophy/69ec5eb4-a138-453f-84db-ec0ee40f1cb0|archive-date=January 28, 2017|access-date=December 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trophy of the NFL is the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after [[Vince Lombardi]], who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.&lt;ref name="Football's super prize reaches icon status"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/01/31/sb-trophy.htm|title=Football's super prize reaches icon status|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|date=January 30, 2002|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219134540/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/01/31/sb-trophy.htm|archive-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded [[Super Bowl ring]]s to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring.&lt;ref name="45 Years of Super Bowl Rings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/rings|title=45 Years of Super Bowl Rings|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206165640/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/rings|archive-date=February 6, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn.&lt;ref name="Super Bowl from A to Z"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/neel/020129.html|title=Super Bowl from A to Z|last=Neel|first=Eric|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=June 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113005948/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/neel/020129.html|archive-date=January 13, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
{{Main|National Football League on television}}
{{See also|List of current National Football League broadcasters}}

In the United States, the National Football League has television contracts with four networks: [[CBS]], [[ESPN]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]]. Collectively, these contracts cover every regular season and postseason game. In general, CBS televises afternoon games in which the away team is an AFC team, and Fox carries afternoon games in which the away team belongs to the NFC. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.&lt;ref name="The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV"&gt;{{cite news|title=The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8250cb48/article/the-tradition-continues-nfl-to-remain-on-broadcast-tv|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715084934/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8250cb48/article/the-tradition-continues-nfl-to-remain-on-broadcast-tv|archive-date=July 15, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as "flexible scheduling").&lt;ref name="Flexible schedule flexes Broncos-Vikings from CBS to FOX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/12/01/flexible-schedule-flexes-broncos-vikings-from-cbs-to-fox/|title=Flexible schedule flexes Broncos-Vikings from CBS to FOX|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=[[Pro Football Talk]].

The league also provides [[NFL RedZone|RedZone]], an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus telecast]] that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen.

In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. NBC broadcasts the primetime ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' package', which includes the Thursday [[NFL Kickoff game]] that starts the regular season and a primetime [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]]. ESPN carries all [[Monday Night Football]] games.&lt;ref name="The tradition continues: NFL to remain on broadcast TV" /&gt; The NFL's own network, [[NFL Network]], broadcasts a series titled ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which was originally exclusive to the network, but which in recent years has had several games [[simulcast]] on CBS (since 2014) and NBC (since 2016) (except the Thanksgiving and kickoff games, which remain exclusive to NBC).&lt;ref name="Thursday Night Football Scores Big for the NFL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/thursday-night-football-scores-big-for-the-nfl|title=Thursday Night Football Scores Big for the NFL|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=November 29, 2012|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201074932/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/thursday-night-football-scores-big-for-the-nfl|archive-date=February 1, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2017 season, the NFL Network will broadcast 18 regular season games under its ''Thursday Night Football'' brand, 16 Thursday-evening contests (10 of which are simulcast on either NBC or CBS) as well as one of the [[NFL International Series]] games on a Sunday morning and one of the 2017 Christmas afternoon games. In addition, 10 of the Thursday night games will be streamed live on [[Amazon Prime]]. In 2017, the NFL games occupied the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $699,602 for Sunday Night Football, $550,709 for Thursday Night Football (NBC), and $549,791 for Thursday Night Football (CBS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Leo | last=Sun | title=NFL games still command high ad prices | url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20171031/281736974712786 | newspaper=Florida Today | location=New York City | pages=3B | date=October 31, 2017 | accessdate=October 31, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015558/https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20171031/281736974712786 | archive-date=November 7, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a [[NFL on television#Blackout policies|blackout policy]] in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]],&lt;ref name="NFL eases local TV blackout restrictions for upcoming season"&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL eases local TV blackout restrictions for upcoming season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a406ee/article/nfl-eases-local-tv-blackout-restrictions-for-upcoming-season?module=HP11_headline_stack|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 30, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810055326/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a406ee/article/nfl-eases-local-tv-blackout-restrictions-for-upcoming-season?module=HP11_headline_stack|archive-date=August 10, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only two games were blacked out in {{nfly|2013}} and none in {{nfly|2014}}.&lt;ref name="Blackout suspended"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12545081/nfl-suspend-tv-blackout-policy-2015-owners-vote |title=NFL to suspend TV blackout policy |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324145057/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12545081/nfl-suspend-tv-blackout-policy-2015-owners-vote |archive-date=March 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]].&lt;ref name="Blackout suspended"/&gt; According to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States.

In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|Westwood One]] (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game.

Some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. Among them, the [[Skycam]] camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] and [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]], and televised by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-10/1985_10_BYTE_10-10_Simulating_Society#page/n121/mode/2up | title=Skycam: An Aerial Robotic Camera System | work=BYTE | date=October 1985 | accessdate=April 2, 2016 | author=Cone, Lawrence L. | pages=122 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326233722/https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-10/1985_10_BYTE_10-10_Simulating_Society#page/n121/mode/2up | archive-date=March 26, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[John Madden]] famously used a [[telestrator]] during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, boosting the device's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Oaks, Chris.

==Draft==
{{Main|National Football League Draft}}

Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round.&lt;ref name="What's the NFL draft all about?

Aside from the 32 picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given.&lt;ref name="NFL Announces 32 Compensatory Draft Choices to 15 Clubs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2012-compensatory-draft-picks2.pdf|title=NFL Announces 32 Compensatory Draft Choices to 15 Clubs|last=Aiello|first=Greg|author2=McCarthy, Brian|author3=Signora, Michael|date=March 26, 2012|publisher=NFL Labor|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002233037/http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/2012-compensatory-draft-picks2.pdf|archive-date=October 2, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the [[2003 NFL Draft|2003 draft]], when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time.

The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a [[National Football League Draft#Supplemental Draft|supplemental draft]] annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.&lt;ref name="Supplemental draft primer: Josh Gordon has NFL teams buzzing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeremiah|first=Daniel|title=Supplemental draft primer: Josh Gordon has NFL teams buzzing|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a78591/article/supplemental-draft-primer-josh-gordon-has-nfl-teams-buzzing|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217025234/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a78591/article/supplemental-draft-primer-josh-gordon-has-nfl-teams-buzzing|archive-date=February 17, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility.&lt;ref name="Terrelle Pryor remains in draft limbo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6861571/terrelle-pryor-wants-state-case-eligibility-nfl-supplemental-draft|title=Terrelle Pryor remains in draft limbo|last=Schefter|first=Adam|date=August 15, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717155735/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6861571/terrelle-pryor-wants-state-case-eligibility-nfl-supplemental-draft|archive-date=July 17, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league holds [[expansion draft]]s, the most recent happening in [[2002 NFL Expansion Draft|2002]] when the [[Houston Texans]] began play as an [[expansion team]].&lt;ref name="Building Block"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/expansion02/index.html|title=Building Block|date=February 12, 2002|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831152844/http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/expansion02/index.html|archive-date=August 31, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drafts held by the league include [[1950 AAFC Dispersal Draft|an allocation draft in 1950]] to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference&lt;ref name="Allocation Draft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/AAFC/Allocation_Draft.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505011322/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/AAFC/Allocation_Draft.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 5, 2012|title=Allocation Draft|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players|supplemental draft in 1984]] to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the [[United States Football League]] or [[Canadian Football League]].&lt;ref name="1984 Supplemental Draft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1456|title=1984 Supplemental Draft|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512185038/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1456|archive-date=May 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major sports leagues in the United States]], the NFL maintains protocol for a [[disaster draft]]. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being canceled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.&lt;ref name="God forbid it should ever be needed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/0328/1163463.html|title='God forbid it should ever be needed'|last=Drehs|first=Wayne|date=April 10, 2001|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107150835/http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/0328/1163463.html|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free agency==
[[Free agent]]s in the National Football League are divided into [[restricted free agent]]s, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and [[unrestricted free agent]]s, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as "six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists".&lt;ref name="Questions and answers for 2012 free agency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions and answers for 2012 free agency|url=http://www.nfl.com/freeagency/story/09000d5d82787135/article/questions-and-answers-for-2012-free-agency|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713170606/http://www.nfl.com/freeagency/story/09000d5d82787135/article/questions-and-answers-for-2012-free-agency|archive-date=July 13, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.&lt;ref name="Questions and answers for 2012 free agency" /&gt;

Clubs are given one [[franchise tag]] to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.&lt;ref name="NFL Explained: The Franchise Tag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfluk.com/opinions/articles/nfl-explained-franchise-tag |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218204906/http://www.nfluk.com/opinions/articles/nfl-explained-franchise-tag |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 18, 2012 |title=NFL Explained: The Franchise Tag |last=Reynolds |first=Neil |date=February 16, 2012 |publisher=NFLUK |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clubs also have the option to use a [[transition tag]], which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer.&lt;ref name="NFL Franchise Tags and the Miami Dolphins"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nogle|first=Kevin|title=NFL Franchise Tags and the Miami Dolphins|url=http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/12/28/3809610/nfl-franchise-tags-and-the-miami-dolphins|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|website=ThePhinsider.com|date=December 28, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131121932/http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/12/28/3809610/nfl-franchise-tags-and-the-miami-dolphins|archive-date=January 31, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,&lt;ref name="New wrinkles to franchise tag, salary cap happened for reason"&gt;{{cite news|last=Breer|first=Albert|title=New wrinkles to franchise tag, salary cap happened for reason|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8272422b/article/new-wrinkles-to-franchise-tag-salary-cap-happened-for-reason|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212030123/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8272422b/article/new-wrinkles-to-franchise-tag-salary-cap-happened-for-reason|archive-date=February 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; even with the removal of the "poison pill" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide.&lt;ref name="The Poison Pill is dead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://12thmanrising.com/2012/02/16/the-poison-pill-is-dead/|title=The Poison Pill is dead|last=Myers|first=Keith|date=February 16, 2008|publisher=12th Man Rising.

Members of clubs' [[Practice squad#National Football League|practice squads]], despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by their original club first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chassen|first=Alexis|title=Everything you need to know about NFL practice squads|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/9/5/9168523/nfl-practice-squad-players-eligibility-salary|publisher=SB Nation|date=September 6, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116104526/http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/9/5/9168523/nfl-practice-squad-players-eligibility-salary|archive-date=November 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8075">The '''GOAT''' Index ("Greatest of All Time") is a system used in sports to rank the best performers in any given role. The concept/name was created by author and analyst Ben Hinson and first used in a 2016 study Hinson created to rank the best [[NBA]] players from the mid 1970s - early 2000s. Hinson's system is the first player scoring methodology to assign different weights (value) to preseason and playoff performance in the scoring calculation. In 2017, [[ESPN]] published their first GOAT Index, ranking the best quarterbacks in the [[NFL]] from 1978 to 2017. The ESPN rankings were based on voting panels, not a scoring methodology.

== Hinson's GOAT Index ==
Hinson's GOAT Index, first published in December 2016 is the first player scoring system to factor in and weight preseason and playoff performance. The system was designed to rank the best [[NBA]] players based on calculated "GT Scores."&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7|title= The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinson's GOAT (GT) Scores account for pacing and rotation minutes as each metric used is assessed on a per 36 minute basis (the only exception being Win Shares, which is assessed on a per 48 minute basis). Unlike Hollinger's [[Player Efficiency Rating]] and Game Scores, GT scores apply equal weight to each metric used, the idea being that no basketball performance metric is more important (or less) than others. By evenly applying defensive, offensive and contribution metrics, no particular player profile is favored. Metrics in the GT index are a combination of general stats like PPG and advanced stats like Win Shares and Usage Rates. Also, the GT Index is not based on a league average, but rather indexes the selected players against themselves, creating an "elite" and holistic way to evaluate performance. As it adjusts for rotation minutes, the GT Index rewards players who make the best use of their time on the court across all facets of the game. The GT Index also factors in effective shooting rates (eFG%), turnovers and personal fouls as weighted metrics, a key difference from Hollinger's PER and Game Scores. Hinson also maintains that traits like a players heart, ability to motivate teammates and other "soft/unmeasurable" traits factor into the Win Share metric.&lt;ref name="G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/g-o-a-t-scoring-faqs-basketball-3cc519585ee1|title= G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 16, 2017|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GOAT Score (GTS) Calculation (Basketball) ==

The formula for Hinson's basketball GT (GOAT) Scores is as follows:

'''Total GTS''',&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-basketball-index-all-star-edition-vol-1-d86c57575da|title= The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)|last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 25, 2018|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the full performance rating for an NBA player. This score combines selected regular season and playoff paced metrics and applies weights to reflect the difference in importance between regular season and playoff games:

'''Playoffs GTS''', which focuses on the performance rating for an NBA player over the playoffs (can also be applied to regular season):

[[File:GT Score Formula (Playoffs GTS).jpg|1100x600px|alt=Example alt text]]

Legend:
* PTS/36 = Points per 36 mins
* eFG = Effective Field Goal %
* FT/36 = Free Throw % per 36 mins
* TRB/36 = Total Rebounds % per 36 mins
* AST/36 = Assist % per 36 mins
* STL/36 = Steals % per 36 mins
* BLK/36 = Block % per 36 mins
* TOV/36 = Turnovers per 36 mins
* USG = Usage Rate
* PF/36 = Personal Fouls per 36 mins
* WS/48 = Win Shares per 48 mins

''Note: For Total GTS, 6.05 equates to 0.06045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Total GTS, 3.05 equates to 0.03045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Playoffs GTS, 9.1 equates to 9.090909 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: totals in denominators refer to the selected player pool totals/averages, not league''

From Hinson's [https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7 2016 GOAT Index], Hakeem Olajuwon edged out Michael Jordan by a fraction of a point to be the "GOAT" from the eras used in the study.

== ESPN GOAT Index ==

In July 2017, [[ESPN]] published [http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017 their first GOAT Index] aimed at ranking the top [[Quarterback|NFL quarterbacks]] in modern history. The ESPN GOAT Index like Hinson's earlier study also considered players from the 1970s, and utilized a voting panel consisting of NFL coaches and executives (all Super Bowl winners), each of whom voted on their top ten quarterbacks.&lt;ref name=" The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017|title= The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978|last=Sando|first=Mike|date=July 19, 2017|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final quarterback rankings were determined based on how frequently any quarterback outranked his peers across all voting ballots. The ESPN voting panel consisted of Pete Carroll, [[Tony Dungy]], Mike Holmgren, Howard Mudd, Wade Phillips, Mike Reinfeldt, Ray Rhodes, Mike Shanahan, Al Saunders and Norv Turner.

[[Tom Brady]] emerged as the GOAT from the [[ESPN]] survey with 86.7% coverage.

The [[History of the National Football League championship|NFL Championships]] describes both the [[List of NFL champions (1920–1969)|Championship games of the National Football League]], which ran from 1920 to 1969; and the [[Super Bowl]], which has run from 1966 to the present. Many players and teams have won these championships on multiple occasions, both during the NFL Championships and the Super Bowl era. The majority of these players were on the [[Green Bay Packers]] between 1960 and 1967, a period in which the Packers won three NFL Championships and the first two Super Bowl games.

==Six Championships==
Four players have won 6 championships counting the pre-Super Bowl era. To avoid double counting from 1966 to 1969, only the NFL champions from 1920-1965, and the Super Bowls from 1966 onward are counted.

The '''International Player Pathway''' ('''IPP''') is a program run by the [[National Football League]] (NFL) to increase the number of non-[[Americans|American]] players in the NFL. According to [[Mark Waller (marketing executive)|Mark Waller]] (NFL Executive Vice President of International &amp; Events 2014–18&lt;ref&gt;https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/16077241/how-african-born-brit-mark-waller-became-one-nfl-most-influential-figures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sloansportsconference.com/people/mark-waller/&lt;/ref&gt;), the program is an important part of the NFL’s overall strategy to grow internationally because it provides international athletes with the opportunity to play in the league which will increase the pool of talent, inspire others and ultimately drive fan growth.&lt;ref&gt;https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-players/four-international-players-added-to-practice-squads-for-2017-season/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[British people|British]]-born former NFL players [[Aden Durde]] (NFLUK head of football development) and two-time [[Super Bowl]] champion [[Osi Umenyiora]] were concerned that there were no clear pathways into the NFL for players who had not gone to high-school and/or college in the United States, and, as a result, the NFL was potentially missing out on some exceptional players. Wanting to remedy this, in early 2016, they utilized their personal and professional contracts from their football days to create a training program and to set-up meetings and try-outs with NFL teams for a small number of specially selected [[American football|football]] players. These players' potentials had been scouted primarily by watching YouTube videos.&lt;ref name="NFL Undiscovered"&gt;{{cite AV media |date=2016 |title=NFL Undiscovered |medium=video |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRdw3IjKY2gmSwA4gV8OaocR4psD1sa6w |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher=NFL }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial group of players all lived, worked and played amateur [[American football|football]] in [[Europe]]. At the time, the program was not yet officially named the International Player Pathway, but it was fully sanctioned and supported by the NFL. Additionally, the League had commissioned a mini-series documentary to be made, called '''[[NFL Undiscovered]]''', that followed the participants of the program.

The following year, the IPP was enacted with systems for choosing which division sponsors the program annually, as well as special regulations applying to the teams being assigned the players. The program has grown every year since its launch and, as of 2019, nearly half (15 of 32) of all NFL teams have already signed international players as a direct result of the program.

==Athlete eligibility and application==
In 2017, potential applicants to [[NFL Undiscovered]] were asked to meet specific requirements and advised to follow a particular application process.  These conditions were published widely through the media&lt;ref&gt;http://dblcoverage.com/are-you-the-next-nfl-undiscovered-star/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanfootballinternational.com/want-chance-play-nfl-nfl-undiscovered-2017-training-programme-launches/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/nfl-draft-2017-undrafted-european-athletes-a7596096.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.skysports.com/nfl/news/12040/10778480/nfl-undiscovered-programme-returns&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ballcharts.com/team/?team=texasindoorfootball&amp;pg=new&amp;id=67820&amp;archived=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.givemesport.com/992499-nfl-undiscovered-2017-training-programme-launches&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nfl-want-talented-young-european-165552092.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKpcsdIvarfnYaFDeC9Gmf6u5YxDoOM3WAP0sQDMXeq7zOy9EE4746dyaxpAkrlVnSEBMO_Sy-RRcuzoQURrr03zwdm3VCXpJG-XM6TZapHpOaCkDUAU_JXcf1yiG53kRNsiEgXuvwDdfDOJIJl6MvtvkkIlftIz1_Az7DdE8wFy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://instantscouting.com/the-nfl-want-talented-young-european-athletes-to-enter-the-draft-heres-how-to-be-in-with-the-chance-of-a-lifetime/&lt;/ref&gt; when they were released and are reproduced below, though these have either changed over time or there is some discretion applied during the selection process as not all the athletes that have come through the program in the intervening years meet all these criteria.

==Roster regulations==
The NFL has specific regulations for players that sign through the IPP. The teams to which each IPP player is assigned are allowed 91 players &lt;ref&gt;https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2019/8/29/20837438/updated-look-at-the-steelers-91-man-roster-with-jersey-numbers-before-preseason-week-4-jhavonte-dean&lt;/ref&gt; on their off-season rosters, one more than those teams that are not participating in the IPP that year.  At the point when these rosters need to be cut to 53 (at the end of pre-season), the participating teams have several options open to them;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/2019/08/buffalo-bills-christian-wade-and-the-international-pathway-program-what-fans-needs-to-know.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buffalorumblings.com/2019/8/18/20810950/clarifying-the-buffalo-bills-roster-status-with-running-back-christian-wade&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://billswire.usatoday.com/2019/08/19/what-the-buffalo-bills-can-do-christian-wade/&lt;/ref&gt;

#* like all players, the IPP player must first clear waivers (where he could be claimed by another team) before being assigned to the practice squad&lt;br&gt;
#* the team can have an 11-man practice squad&lt;br&gt;
#* the player cannot be called-up to the 53-man roster that season but also cannot be claimed by another club&lt;br&gt;

#* like all players, the IPP player must first clear waivers&lt;br&gt;
#* the team can only have a regular 10-man practice squad&lt;br&gt;
#* the player is a regular member of the practice squad so can be called-up to the 53-man roster and can also be claimed by another club&lt;br&gt;
# cut their IPP player after clearing waivers&lt;br&gt;
#* the IPP player could be signed to another team's practice squad but they won't get the 11th man exemption for him

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3525">'''Non-football injury''' and '''non-football illness''' lists ('''NFI''') are roster designations used in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for players who are unable to practice as a result of conditions unrelated to football, or injuries that did not occur during NFL games or practices. They are similar to the [[physically unable to perform]] and [[injured reserve]] lists.

==Active/NFI==
Players who report to training camp injured or ill due to injuries or illnesses sustained outside of NFL practices or games can be placed on the active/non-football injury or active/non-football illness lists while they recover. A player cannot remain on an NFI list if they participate in a practice or game during the preseason. Players on these lists still count towards the 90-man roster limits prior to the start of the regular season. If a player on the active/NFI list is still injured or ill by the final roster cutdown date, they can be placed on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists and not count towards the 53-man roster limit.

==Reserve/NFI==
Players on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists are ineligible to practice or play in games for the first six weeks of the regular season. After six weeks, a player can begin practicing with their team but cannot be moved to the active roster until after the team has played its first eight games of the season. When a player starts practicing, a three-week window begins in which the player can be moved to the active roster. If a player does not get activated after the three-week window ends, they must remain on the reserve/NFI list for the rest of the season. Only up to two players from the NFI lists are eligible to return to the active roster for each NFL team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2018 Bylaw Proposal No. 9 |url=https://nflcommunications.com/Documents/2018%20Offseason/Approved%20Rules%20Proposals%203.29.pdf |website=NFLCommunications.com |year=2018 |accessdate=September 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL teams are not required to pay base salaries to players placed on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bonesteel, Matt |title=What does it mean when an NFL player is sent to the PUP list? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/29/what-does-it-mean-when-an-nfl-player-is-sent-to-the-pup-list/ |website=WashingtonPost.com |date=July 29, 2016 |accessdate=September 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NFLPA logo.png|thumb|NFLPA Logo]]
The '''NFL Players Association's Financial Advisors Registration Program''' is a program that will provide NFL players with access to a list of financial advisors who are deemed qualified by the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nflpa.com/financial-advisors/financial-advisors-application-and-renewal|title=NFL Players Association - Financial Advisors Application and Renewal|website=www.nflpa.com|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was created in 2002 after a series of many investment schemes targeted at professional athletes. Advisors must apply to the program and go through a full background check before being added to the list. In October 2019, the NFLPA began inviting financial institutions to register with the program, and currently have partnerships with [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Bessemer Trust]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportsagentblog.com/2019/10/23/nflpa-brings-in-goldman-sachs-as-a-registered-financial-advisor/|title=NFLPA Brings in Goldman Sachs as a Registered Financial Advisor – SPORTS AGENT BLOG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While players can ultimately choose any investment advisor that they would like to work with, their sports agents can only recommend registered advisors on the list.

== Responsibility of a financial advisor ==
A [[financial adviser]] is a professional who works on behalf of an individual and provides them with advice to help them reach their financial goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/financial-advisor/|title=Financial Advisor - Overview, Roles and Responsibilities, Salaries|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their responsibilities include but are not limited to: understanding the financial markets, creating budgets, saving for retirement, tax planning, and building portfolios.The financial advisors registered in the NFLPA program specifically, have a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] to their clients, meaning that legally they must put their clients interests first and represent clients objectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/NFLPA/FinancialAdvisors/Final%20Financial%20Advisors%20Regs%20October%2024.pdf|title=NFL Players Association Regulations and Code of Conduct|last=|first=|date=|website=nflpaweb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
The NFLPA established the Financial Advisors Registration Program in 2002, with the goal of protecting players from investment schemes. The NFLPA mentions that the players themselves requested a program like this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many players come into the league at a young age, are uneducated and inexperienced financially, and therefore, can easily be targeted by scammers. The Financial Advisors Registration Program aims to eliminate this risk, and provide players with advisors and agents who are pre-screened by the NFL.

== Registration of a financial firm ==
As of October 2019, the NFLPA is allowing firms to join their program, on an invite-only basis. Currently, the NFLPA is partnered with Goldman Sachs and Bessemer Trust.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The addition of financial institutions to the program will allow for an extra layer of protection for the players. Now, if a player loses money due to an investment scam, the firm behind the advisor will be responsible for recovering the loss. This change comes as there is a possibility of a work stoppage for players after the 2019-2020 season.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The NFLPA wants to ensure that players' money will be invested and budgeted well during the potential work stoppage, and throughout the rest of their career into retirement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Application process for individual advisors ==
For individual advisors, the initial fee to apply is $2,500. This consists of a $2,000 application fee and $500 for the first year of membership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the advisor does not get approved to join the list, the $500 membership fee will be refunded. To apply for the program, an advisor must have a number of qualifications; these include but are not limited to:
*Bachelor's degree from an accredited university.
*Every Applicant shall be a [[Certified Financial Planner|CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER]]™ (CFP®) and/or a [[Chartered Financial Analyst]]® (CFA). An individual who is currently a Registered Player Financial Advisor, but is not a CFP® or CFA must become compliant within three years of implementation of this Regulation, which is November 1, 2017.
*Minimum of eight (8) years of licensed experience (qualifying licenses include [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|FINRA]] series licenses, Attorney, CPA or an insurance license).
*Fidelity bonding and professional liability insurance coverage as indicated in Section Two II D of the Regulations.
*No civil, criminal or regulatory history related to fraud.
*No pending customer complaints or litigation at the time of application.
*Must not maintain custody of player funds unless deemed a qualified custodian&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History of fraud in the NFL ==
Between 1999 and 2002, at least 78 NFL players had been defrauded of more than $42 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.marquette.edu/assets/sports-law/pdf/for-the-record/v21i4.pdf|title=Financial Fraud Is One of the Biggest Off- Field Challenges to NFL Players|last=Landsman|first=Laurence|date=|website=law.marquette.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss was a total of many investment schemes intended to target misinformed athletes. The goal of the NFL's Financial Advisors Registration Program is to protect players from these schemes, but there are still cases involving advisors defrauding professional athletes.

=== Kirk Wright ===
Wright, a hedge fund manager, was an approved advisor on the NFL's list. He hired an ex-NFL player as a consultant to his firm, and used him as a means to attract NFL players as clients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When his business collapsed, Wright was charged and convicted of 47 counts of fraud and money laundering. Wright gave clients statement which showed that their investments were worth up to 1000 times more than their real value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlpc.org/2008/06/16/atlanta-hedge-fund-manager-found-guilty-kills-self/|title=Atlanta Hedge Fund Manager Found Guilty, Kills Self|last=Horowitz|first=Carl|date=2008-06-16|website=National Legal &amp; Policy Center|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven NFL players who were involved in this scheme lost about $20 million.

=== Jeff Rubin ===
Rubin was one of the largest financial advisors in the NFL, with at least 45 players as clients.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/nfl--raucous-lifestyle-leads-to-fall-of-jeff-rubin--former-financial-adviser-to-nfl-players-.html|title=Raucous lifestyle leads to fall of Jeff Rubin, former financial adviser to NFL players|website=www.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon trusted amongst athletes when he saved them from a ponzi scheme involving a former NFL agent, [[William "Tank" Black]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rubin's fall came when he advised clients to invest in a new casino establishment in Alabama, but when electronic bingo was later deemed illegal by the state of Alabama, the casino got raided and shut down.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-preview-thrown-for-a-loss/|title=NFL players lost $43M on his financial advice|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this investment, his clients lost a total of $43 million.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rubin was a registered advisor on the NFLPA financial advisors program, but noted that they never contacted him regarding the investments he had his clients in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Jinesh "Hodge" Brahmbhatt ===
Brahmbhatt was a registered financial advisor with the NFLPA and ran his own company, Jade Wealth Management, where he had many clients who were NFL and NBA players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/agoodman/2013/06/27/the-ponzi-scheme-youve-never-heard-of-that-cost-nfl-nba-players-millions/|title=The Ponzi Scheme You've Never Heard Of That Cost NFL, NBA Players Millions|last=Goodman|first=Andrew|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had more than 30 of his clients invest in a company called Success Trade Securities (STS). STS was an online trading company where the CEO was later accused of running a Ponzi scheme; he would use newly issued promissory notes to pay off interest on older notes issued. The FINRA report accused Jade Wealth Management of recommending STS to athletes, and in turn, Jade received $1.25 million from STS over a few years. Brahmbhatt admitted that his clients invested more than $12 million in fraud notes from STS. After failing to provide the NFLPA with information on his role in the alleged fraudulent activities, the NFLPA removed him from their financial advisors program.

The '''Super Bowl''' is the annual championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) typically played annually between the champion of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). The game is the culmination of a [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] that begins in the late summer of the previous year.

The game was created as a part of the [[AFL-NFL merger|merger agreement]] between the NFL and its then-rival, the [[American Football League]] (AFL). It was agreed that the two's champion teams would play in the '''AFL–NFL World Championship Game''' until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, each league was re-designated as a "[[Conference (sports)|conference]]", and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league champion.

The [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] have the most Super Bowl championship titles, with six. The [[New England Patriots]] have the most Super Bowl appearances, with eleven. The [[National Football Conference]] leads the league with 27 wins to 26 wins for the [[American Football Conference]].

Because of the high viewership, [[Super Bowl advertising|commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast]] is the most expensive of the year, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast.

==Origin==
For four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, the NFL encountered its most serious competitor when the [[American Football League]] (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. The original "bowl game" was the [[Rose Bowl Game]] in [[Pasadena, California]], which was first played in 1902 as the "Tournament East-West football game" as part of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] and moved to the new [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The Tournament of Roses football game eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the [[Orange Bowl]]), New Orleans (the [[Sugar Bowl]]), and [[El Paso]] (the [[Sun Bowl]]) in 1935, and for [[Dallas]] (the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]]) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term "bowl" for any major American football game was well established.

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL–NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I).]]
[[Lamar Hunt]], owner of the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]], first used the term "Super Bowl"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwestsportsfans.com/2012/01/super-bowl-why-do-we-call-it-that-why-roman-numerals/ |title='Super Bowl' – Why Do We Call It That? Why Roman Numerals? |author=Tinley, Josh |date=January 31, 2012 |work=Midwest Sports Fans |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the NFL-AFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a [[Super Ball]] toy;&lt;ref name=cabpirsb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OspaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1nsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7015%2C4718358 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title=Corny and a bit presumptuous, but it's still the 'Super Bowl' |date=January 7, 1970 |page=1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; a vintage example of the ball is on display at the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, "I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon."

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 37 - Joe Namath (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Jets were the first AFL team to win a Super Bowl (Super Bowl III), defeating the Colts.]]
After the NFL's [[Green Bay Packers]] won the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the NFL's [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]] in Miami. One year later, the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23–7 in [[Super Bowl IV]] in New Orleans, which was the final AFL-NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the [[Baltimore Colts]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Cleveland Browns]]) would constitute the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.

The winning team receives the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], named after the [[Vince Lombardi|coach]] of the [[Green Bay Packers]], who won the first two Super Bowl games and three of the five preceding [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championships]] in 1961, 1962, and 1965. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in [[Super Bowl V]] in Miami.

==Date==
The Super Bowl is currently played on the first Sunday in February. This is due to the current NFL schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after [[Labor Day]] (the first Monday in September), the 17-week [[National Football League regular season|regular season]] (where teams each play 16 games and have one [[Bye (sports)|bye]]), the first three rounds of the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]], and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship Games, which is the next week after the [[Pro Bowl]]. This schedule has been in effect since [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February 2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day in 2015 occurred on September 7; therefore the next Super Bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on February 7, 2016.

Originally, the game took place in early to mid-January. For Super Bowl I there was only one round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL Championship Games. The addition of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978, the season started as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full Sunday set of games (Since 2002, the regular season has started with the [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] on the first Thursday after Labor Day). The earliest possible season start date is September 7.

The [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are tied with six Super Bowl wins; the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] have five victories each, while the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[New York Giants]] have four Super Bowl championships. Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl.

The Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances overall (eleven), the most Super Bowls reached (nine) and won (six) by a [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|head coach–quarterback tandem]] ([[Bill Belichick]] and [[Tom Brady]]). The [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, achieving reaching that milestone in this respective order. Belichick [[Super Bowl ring#Most Super Bowl rings|owns the record]] for most Super Bowl wins (eight) and participation in any capacity (twelve, nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator). [[Dan Reeves]] previously held the Super Bowl participation record in any capacity (nine, twice as a player, three times as assistant coach, and four times as head coach). Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (nine) and wins as a player (six), while [[Charles Haley]] has the second-most wins among players (five).

Eight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] won the last NFL Championship before the merger but lost to the AFL champion [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in Super Bowl IV and became the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. The [[Buffalo Bills]] played in a record four Super Bowls in a row and lost every one. The Patriots and [[Denver Broncos]] are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (five).

Four teams (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and [[Houston Texans]]) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the creation of the Super Bowl, while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion teams. Detroit, Houston, and Jacksonville, however, have hosted a Super Bowl, leaving the Browns the only team to date who has neither played in nor whose city has hosted the game.

===1960s: Early history===
The [[Green Bay Packers]] won the first two Super Bowls (Known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game for these first two contests), defeating the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Oakland Raiders]] following the {{nfly|1966}} and {{nfly|1967}} seasons, respectively. The Packers were led by quarterback, [[Bart Starr]], who was named the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP)]] for both games. These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in {{nfly|1961}}, {{nfly|1962}}, and {{nfly|1965}}, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the only [[threepeat]] in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967).

In [[Super Bowl III]], the AFL's [[New York Jets]] defeated the eighteen-point favorite [[Baltimore Colts]] of the NFL, 16–7. The Jets were led by quarterback [[Joe Namath]], who had famously guaranteed a Jets win prior to the game, and former Colts head coach [[Weeb Ewbank]], and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following year when the AFL's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defeated the NFL's [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23–7 in [[Super Bowl IV]].

===1970s: Dominant franchises===
After the [[AFL–NFL merger]] was completed in 1970, three franchises&amp;nbsp;– the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]&amp;nbsp;– would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls in the decade.

The [[Baltimore Colts]], now a member of the [[American Football Conference|AFC]], would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in [[Super Bowl V]], a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] (Cowboys' linebacker [[Chuck Howley]]). Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game.

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 46 - Terry Bradshaw (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.]]
The Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won [[Super Bowl VI]] over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss in over a year, as [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the next year]], the Dolphins would go 14–0 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14–7 victory in [[Super Bowl VII]], becoming the first and only team to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason. The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning [[Super Bowl VIII]] a year later.

In the late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl IX|IX]], [[Super Bowl X|X]], [[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], and [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]]) in six years. They were led by head coach [[Chuck Noll]], the play of offensive stars [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Franco Harris]], [[Lynn Swann]], [[John Stallworth]], and [[Mike Webster]], and their dominant "[[Steel Curtain]]" defense, led by [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean" Joe Greene]], [[L. C. Greenwood]], [[Ernie Holmes]], [[Mel Blount]], [[Jack Ham]], and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. The coaches and administrators also were part of the dynasty's greatness as evidenced by the team's "final pieces" being part of the famous [[1974 NFL Draft|1974 draft]]. The selections in that class have been considered the best by any pro franchise ever, as Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft. The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six [[AFC Championship Game]]s during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons. Nine players and three coaches and administrators on the team have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.

The Steelers' dynasty was interrupted only by the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[Super Bowl XI]] win and the Cowboys winning their second Super Bowl of the decade.

===1981–1996: The NFC's winning streak===
In the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from [[Super Bowl XIX]] to [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. The NFC's winning streak was only interrupted when the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] routed the [[Washington Redskins]], 38–9 in [[Super Bowl XVIII]].

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The 49ers playing against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX.]]
The most successful team of the 1980s was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], which featured the [[West Coast offense]] of Hall of Fame head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Joe Montana]], Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], running back [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]], and defensive safety/cornerback [[Ronnie Lott]]. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXIV|XXIV]]) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.

The 1980s also produced the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], who posted an 18–1 record under head coach [[Mike Ditka]]; quarterback [[Jim McMahon]]; and Hall of Fame running back [[Walter Payton]]. Their team won [[Super Bowl XX]] in dominant fashion. The [[Washington Redskins]] and [[New York Giants]] were also top teams of this period; the Redskins won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], and [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]. The Giants claimed Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXI|XXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. As in the 1970s, the [[Oakland Raiders]] were the only team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XV|XV]] and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]] (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).

Following several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the [[Buffalo Bills]] had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], [[Super Bowl XXVIII|XXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXX|XXX]]) led by quarterback [[Troy Aikman]], running back [[Emmitt Smith]], and wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]]. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title overall with [[Super Bowl XXIX]] in dominating fashion under Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback [[Steve Young]], Hall of Fame wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], and Hall of Fame cornerback [[Deion Sanders]]; however, the Cowboys' victory in [[Super Bowl XXX]] the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with [[Deion Sanders|Sanders]] after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the [[Green Bay Packers]] who, under Hall of Fame quarterback [[Brett Favre]], won [[Super Bowl XXXI]], their first championship since [[Super Bowl II]] in the late 1960s.

===1997–2009: AFC resurgence and the rise of the Patriots===
[[Super Bowl XXXII]] saw quarterback [[John Elway]] and running back [[Terrell Davis]] lead the [[Denver Broncos]] to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's 13-year winning streak. The following year, the Broncos defeated the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams&amp;nbsp;– the Steelers, [[New England Patriots]], Broncos, [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[Indianapolis Colts]] – accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.

[[File:Patriots on offense at Super Bowl XXXIX 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriots playing against the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX.]]
The [[New England Patriots]] became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s [[Dallas Cowboys]]). In [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], first-year starting quarterback [[Tom Brady]] led his team to a 20–17 upset victory over the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/5981692/what-was-the-best-super-bowl-ever-ranking-all-47-games-according-to-watchability |title=What Was The Best Super Bowl Ever? Ranking All 47 Games According To Watchability |last1=Fischer-Baum |first1=Reuben |date=February 6, 2013 |publisher=Deadspin.com |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]] defeating the [[Carolina Panthers]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] respectively. This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]' 48–21 [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]].

The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Indianapolis Colts]] continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XL|XL]] and [[Super Bowl XLI|XLI]] in 2005–06 and 2006–07, respectively defeating the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Chicago Bears]].

In the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16–0. They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. However, they lost that game to [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] 17–14, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18–1.

The following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title ([[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]]) in a 27–23, final-minute victory against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].

The 2009 season saw the [[New Orleans Saints]] defeat the Indianapolis Colts in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] by a score of 31–17 to take home their first Championship. With this victory, the Saints joined the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[New York Jets]] as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance.

=== 2010–2019: The Patriots' second run; parity in the NFC ===
In the AFC, this era was dominated by the [[New England Patriots]], with the only three other teams to represent the conference being the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Denver Broncos]] and Baltimore Ravens. The Super Bowls of the late 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, [[Tom Brady]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], or [[Peyton Manning]] appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls between 2001 and 2018. On the flip side, the only NFC team to make the Super Bowl twice in this era was the [[Seattle Seahawks]], led by quarterback [[Russell Wilson]].

One of these teams was featured in the culmination of the [[2010 NFL season|2010 Season]], [[Super Bowl XLV]], which brought the [[Green Bay Packers]] their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in February 2011. This became [[Aaron Rodgers]]' only Super Bowl victory.

The following year, in [[Super Bowl XLVI]], the New England Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the [[Eli Manning]] led [[New York Giants]], 21–17, who had beaten the Patriots four years before. This was the Giants 4th Super Bowl victory.

In [[Super Bowl XLVII]] the NFC's [[San Francisco 49ers]] were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens 34–31. The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, [[John Harbaugh]] and [[Jim Harbaugh]], are brothers. During the 3rd quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28–6 lead over the 49ers. At this time, however there was a [[Power outage|blackout]] in New Orleans, where the game was being played. The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 unanswered points, but lost anyway.

[[Super Bowl XLVIII]], played at [[New Jersey]]'s [[MetLife Stadium]] in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The Seattle Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43–8 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.

In [[Super Bowl XLIX]], the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28-24.

In [[Super Bowl 50]], the first Super Bowl to be branded with [[Arabic numerals]], the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the [[Carolina Panthers]], who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career. [[Von Miller]] dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two [[Cam Newton]] fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.

In [[Super Bowl LI]], the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, the [[Atlanta Falcons]] sat atop a 28–3 lead late in the third quarter, but lost to the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] 34–28 in overtime. Tom Brady was awarded his record 4th Super Bowl MVP.

In [[Super Bowl LII]], the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] defeated the defending Super Bowl champions, the Patriots, 41–33. It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance, and their first win in franchise history. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] had the most successful playoff showing for a Super Bowl host team by winning their Divisional Playoff Game at home against the Saints by taking a touchdown at the last 7 seconds, but lost the NFC Championship game to the Eagles, thus denying the Vikings from being the first team to contest the Super Bowl in their [[U.S. Bank Stadium|own stadium]].

In [[Super Bowl LIII]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]] had made their first appearance since relocating from St. Louis in 2016. The Rams fell to the [[New England Patriots]] by a score of 13–3 in the lowest scoring Super Bowl of all-time and [[Julian Edelman]] was awarded Super Bowl MVP.

The Super Bowl is one of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.&lt;ref name="Viewership"/&gt; The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the [[UEFA Champions League]] final.&lt;ref name="Viewership"&gt;{{cite news|title=Champions League final tops Super Bowl for TV market|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8490351.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most watched United States originating television program of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/216526/super-bowl-us-tv-viewership/ Statistics on Super Bowl TV Viewership in the US], Nielsen Media Research, February 2013.

This means that on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.

However, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in various media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a common misperception about the game's actual global audience.&lt;ref name="si_rushin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/steve_rushin/02/03/rushin0206/ |title=A Billion People ''Can'' Be Wrong |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210132742/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/steve_rushin/02/03/rushin0206/ |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |last=Rushin |first=Steve |url-status=dead |archivedate=December 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/2006-02-03-voa5.cfm?CFID=86843309&amp;CFTOKEN=86609833 |title=Super Bowl XL to Attract Close to 1 Billion Viewers Worldwide |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=February 3, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924184703/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-02/2006-02-03-voa5.cfm |archivedate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the 2005 Super Bowl at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly 2 million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.&lt;ref name="si_rushin"/&gt;

The highest-rated game according to Nielsen was [[Super Bowl XVI]] in 1982, which was watched in 49.1% of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States on game day, leaving residents to stay at home more than usual. Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, and three other Super Bowls, [[Super Bowl XII|XII]], [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], and [[Super Bowl XX|XX]], made the top ten.&lt;ref name="top-rated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/tv-toprated.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513153855/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/tv-toprated.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |title=Television's Top-Rated Programs |date=April 30, 2000 |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |publisher=[[Nielsen Media Research]] |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous commercial campaigns include the [[Budweiser]] "[[Bud Bowl]]" campaign, the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, and the 1999 and 2000 [[dot-com company|dot-com]] ads. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, prices have also increased every year, with advertisers paying as much as $3.5 million for a thirty-second spot during [[Super Bowl XLVI]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Super Bowl ads cost average of $3.5M|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7544243/super-bowl-2012-commercials-cost-average-35m|accessdate=February 11, 2012|agency=Associated Press|date=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view [[advertising in the Super Bowl|commercials]].&lt;ref name=FlaToday/&gt; In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2010/survey-most-super-bowl-viewers-tune-in-for-the-commercials.html "Most Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials"].

===Lead-out programming===
{{See also|List of Super Bowl lead-out programs}}
The Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted on the coattails from [[Super Bowl XLVII]], which aired on [[CBS]]: "A [[infomercial|paid program]] that ran on Channel 4 ([[WIVB-TV]]) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some [[The CW Television Network|CW]] prime time shows get on [[WNLO-TV]], Channel 4's sister station."&lt;ref&gt;Pergament, Alan (February 6, 2013). [http://stilltalkintv.com/2013/02/american-idol-slipping-here-and-nationally/ "American Idol" Slipping Here and Nationally] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213135538/http://stilltalkintv.com/2013/02/american-idol-slipping-here-and-nationally/ |date=February 13, 2013 }}. Retrieved February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series, or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage.

Early Super Bowls featured a halftime show consisting of [[marching band]]s from local [[university|colleges]] or [[High school (North America)|high schools]]; but as the popularity of the game increased, a trend where popular singers and musicians performed during its pre-game ceremonies and the [[halftime show]], or simply sang the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem of the United States]] or [[America the Beautiful]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/entertainment|title=Super Bowl – Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sketch comedy series ''[[In Living Color]]'' caused a drop in viewership for the [[Super Bowl XXVI]] halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached [[Michael Jackson]], whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How Jackson Redefined the Super Bowl | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/sports/football/30sandomir.html | first=Richard | last=Sandomir | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 29, 2009 | accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trib-goalofspectacle&gt;{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=January 30, 2013|date=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable performance came during [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] in 2002, when [[U2]] performed; during their third song, "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].

For many years, [[Whitney Houston]]'s [[The Star Spangled Banner (Whitney Houston song)|performance]] of the national anthem at [[Super Bowl XXV]] in 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], had long been regarded as one of the best renditions of the anthem in history.&lt;ref name="ABC Hudson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WinterConcert/story?id=6788924&amp;page=1|title=Hudson's Super Bowl Lip-Sync No Surprise to Insiders|publisher=ABC News|date=February 3, 2009|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitting"&gt;{{cite news|title=A fitting wartime rendition|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=February 4, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rollingstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/07/03/our-national-anthem-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/|title=Our National Anthem: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in an historic, groundbreaking, and emotional performance prior to [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], soprano [[Renee Fleming]] became the first opera singer to perform the anthem, propelling [[Fox Network|FOX]] to the highest ratings of any program in its history, and remains so today.

The halftime show of [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] attracted [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|controversy]], following an incident in which [[Justin Timberlake]] removed a piece of [[Janet Jackson]]'s top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] (and a larger crackdown over "[[indecency|indecent]]" content broadcast on television), and [[MTV]] (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], under [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as [[Paul McCartney]], [[The Who]], [[Prince (singer)|Prince]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. This practice ended at [[Super Bowl XLV]], which returned to using current pop acts such as [[The Black Eyed Peas]] and [[Katy Perry]].&lt;ref name="tdb-halftimechanges"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boobs, Beyoncé, &amp; Brass Bands: The Evolution of the Super Bowl Halftime Show|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/boobs-beyonce-brass-bands-the-evolution-of-the-super-bowl-halftime-show.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 Best Super Bowl Halftime Shows|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-10-best-super-bowl-halftime-shows-20130131/6-janet-jackson-justin-timberlake-jessica-simpson-nelly-p-diddy-kid-rock-super-bowl-xxxviii-2004-0804366|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of [[Super Bowl LII]], 27 of 52 Super Bowls have been played in three cities: New Orleans (ten times), the [[Miami metropolitan area|Greater Miami]] area (ten times), and the [[Greater Los Angeles area]] (seven times).

Retrieved November 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning market is not, however, required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team uses, and nine Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time. For example, Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all played at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

No team has ever played the [[Super Bowl curse#The Home Field Advantage Curse|Super Bowl in its home stadium]]. The closest any team has come was the [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|2017 Minnesota Vikings]], who were within one win of playing [[Super Bowl LII]] in [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], but lost the NFC Championship game to the Philadelphia Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the [[Minneapolis Miracle|Vikings won]]); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market: the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who played [[Super Bowl XIX]] in [[Stanford Stadium]] instead of [[Candlestick Park]]; and the [[Los Angeles Rams]], who played [[Super Bowl XIV]] in the Rose Bowl instead of the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. In both cases, the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large, high-profile event than the stadiums the Rams and 49ers were playing in at the time. This situation has not arisen since 1993, in part because the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand-new or recently renovated stadiums, alongside a trend of teams [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy#Aftermath and legacy|demanding public money or relocating]] to play in new stadiums. Besides those two, the only other Super Bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an NFL team at the time was [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] in [[Houston]]: the [[Houston Oilers]] had played there previously, but moved to the [[Astrodome]] several years prior to [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50&amp;nbsp;°F (10&amp;nbsp;°C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |author-link=Adam Earnheardt |editor1-last=Swayne |editor1-first=Linda E. |editor2-last=Dodds |editor2-first=Mark |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing |title=Super Bowl |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TjDiwwaN5VsC|page=1509}} |date=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=4 |isbn=978-1412973823 |pages=1508–1511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—[[Super Bowl XVI]] at [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] and [[Super Bowl XL]] at [[Ford Field]] in Detroit, two in [[Minneapolis]]—[[Super Bowl XXVI]] at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] and [[Super Bowl LII]] at the [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], one in [[Indianapolis]] at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] for [[Super Bowl XLVI]], and one in the New York area—[[Super Bowl XLVIII]] at [[MetLife Stadium]]. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule, with a contingency plan to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NFL Makes Contingency Plans for Super Bowl 2014 Blizzard |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-18/nfl-makes-contingency-plans-for-super-bowl-2014-blizzard.html/ |first=Terrence |last=Dopp |work=USA Today |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Is this a contradiction of the "Selection process" section below?--&gt; MetLife Stadium's selection over [[Hard Rock Stadium|Sun Life Stadium]] generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to Sun Life Stadium (in the event of rainstorms) in order to considered for future Super Bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun Life Stadium 'Absolutely' Needs A Roof: Commissioner Pepe Diaz |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/pepe-diaz-fund-sun-life-renovations-roof_n_2198205.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in 1993 was originally awarded to [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in [[Tempe, Arizona]], but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] as a paid state-employees’ holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = George | first = Thomas | title = Phoenix Gets '93 Super Bowl if King Holiday Goes Statewide; '93 Super Bowl to Phoenix If King Holiday Wins Vote Football | pages = D27 | work = The New York Times|date = March 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, [[Super Bowl XXX]] in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to [[Hard Rock Stadium|Pro Player Stadium]] in greater Miami. [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to [[SDCCU Stadium]] in San Diego. [[Super Bowl XLIV]], slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed [[West Side Stadium]], because the city, [[New York (state)|state]], and proposed tenants [[New York Jets]] could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to [[Hard Rock Stadium|Sun Life Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 was originally given to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box, and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2458407 | title = No rolling roof, no Super Bowl at Arrowhead | publisher = ESPN | agency = Associated Press | accessdate =January 15, 2007 | date = May 25, 2006 | authorlink = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to [[State Farm Stadium|University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]].

In 2011, Texas [[Attorney General]] [[Greg Abbott]] said, "[The Super Bowl is] commonly known as the single largest [[human trafficking]] incident in the United States." According to ''[[Forbes]]'', 10,000 prostitutes were brought to Miami in 2010 for the Super Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Eleanor|title=Super Bowl Is Single Largest Human Trafficking Incident In U.S.: Attorney General|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/03/super-bowl-sex-trafficking_n_2607871.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Snopes]]'' research in 2015 determined that the actual number of prostitutes involved in a typical Super Bowl weekend is less than 100, not statistically higher than any other time of the year, and that the notion of mass increases in human trafficking around the Super Bowl was a politician's myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/sports/football/escort.asp|title=Pro Bowl: Super Bowl Prostitution Increase|work=Snopes.com|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection process===
The location of the Super Bowl is chosen by the NFL well in advance, usually three to five years before the game. Cities place bids to host a Super Bowl and are evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host.{{Update inline|date=May 2018|reason=Selection process changed in 2018}}&lt;ref name="site"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-09-22-ny-nj-superbowl_x.htm|title=N.Y./N.J.

Some of the host requirements include:
* The host stadium must be in a market that hosts an NFL team and must have a minimum of 70,000 seats, with the media and electrical amenities necessary to produce the Super Bowl. Stadiums may include temporary seating for Super Bowls, but seating must be approved by the league. Stadiums where the average game day temperature is below 50° Fahrenheit must either have a roof or a waiver given by the league. There must be a minimum of 35,000 parking spaces within one mile of the stadium.
* The host stadium must have space for the Gameday Experience, a large pregame entertainment area, within walking distance of the stadium.
* The host city must have space for the NFL Experience, the interactive football theme park which is operated the week prior to the Super Bowl. An indoor venue for the event must have a minimum of 850,000 square feet, and an outdoor venue must have a minimum of 1 million square feet. Additionally, there must be space nearby for the Media Center, and space for all other events involved in the Super Bowl week, including golf courses and bowling alleys.
* The necessary infrastructure must be in place around the stadium and other Super Bowl facilities, including parking, security, electrical needs, media needs, communication needs, and transportation needs.
* There must be a minimum number of hotel spaces within one hour's drive of the stadium equaling 35% of the stadium's capacity, along with hotels for the teams, officials, media, and other dignitaries. (For [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], the city of Jacksonville docked several luxury cruise liners at their port to act as temporary hotel space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1248|title=Cruise Ships Score Touchdown in Jacksonville for Super Bowl XXXIX|date=February 4, 2005|accessdate=February 3, 2015|work=Cruise Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* There must be practice space of equal and comparable quality for both teams within a 20-minute drive of the team hotels, and rehearsal space for all events within a reasonable distance to the stadium. The practice facilities must have one grass field and at least one field of the same surface as the host stadium.
* The stadium must have a minimum of 70,000 fixed seats, including club and fixed suite seating, during regular season operations.

The NFL owners meet to make a selection on the site, usually three to five years prior to the event. In 2007, NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3065254 ESPN&amp;nbsp;– Goodell says NFL to look into playing Super Bowl in London – NFL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [[Associated Press]], [[ESPN]], October 15, 2007. Retrieved January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The game has never been played in a region that lacks an NFL franchise; seven Super Bowls have been played in Los Angeles, but none were held there in the 21-year period when the league had no team in the area.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--Hasn't there been games played in stadiums that have not hosted an NFL franchise? This needs clarification and perhaps can be removed as it is duplicative of the "Venue" section above.--&gt; New Orleans, the site of the 2013 Super Bowl, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/01/28/nfl-super-bowl-super-gras-favorite-city-new-orleans|title=For NFL, New Orleans has always been a ball|author=Craig Johnson|work=HLNtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[Super Bowl LVI]], teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls. The league rescinded this privilege in 2018 and will make all decisions regarding hosting sites from [[Super Bowl LVII]] onward; the league will choose a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team will put together a hosting proposal, and the league will vote upon it to determine if it is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teope|first1=Herbie|title=Arizona, New Orleans chosen as Super Bowl hosts|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000933935/article/arizona-new-orleans-chosen-as-super-bowl-hosts|website=nfl.com|publisher=[[NFL]]|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home team designation===
The designated "[[home team]]" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Ralph|title=Vikings would be the "away" team in Super Bowl LII|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000907420/article/vikings-would-be-the-away-team-in-super-bowl-lii|publisher=National Football League|website=NFL.com|date=January 16, 2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=XLII facts about Super Bowl XLII |url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/story?id=09000d5d8062bc41&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true |quote=The AFC is the home team in this year's Super Bowl [Super Bowl XLII]. |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202232631/http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/story?id=09000d5d8062bc41&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true |archivedate=February 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This alternation was initiated with the [[Super Bowl I|first Super Bowl]], when the [[Green Bay Packers]] were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team [[logo]] and [[wordmark]] painted in one of the [[end zone]]s. Designated away teams have won 30 of 51 Super Bowls to date (approximately 59%).

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 09 - Mark Murphy (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] are one of six home teams that chose to wear their white jersey, shown here in [[Super Bowl XVII]].]]
Since [[Super Bowl XIII]] in January 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white [[jersey (clothing)|jerseys]]. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for [[Super Bowl V]]. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been six (6) exceptions: the Dallas Cowboys during [[Super Bowl XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]], the [[Washington Redskins]] during [[Super Bowl XVII]], the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] during [[Super Bowl XL]], the [[Denver Broncos]] during [[Super Bowl 50]], and the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LII]]. The Cowboys, since {{nfly|1964}}, have worn white jerseys at home. The Redskins wore white at home under coach [[Joe Gibbs]] starting in {{nfly|1981}} through {{nfly|1992}}, continued by [[Richie Petitbon]] and [[Norv Turner]] through {{nfly|2000}}, then again when Gibbs returned from {{nfly|2004}} through {{nfly|2007}}. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL–NFL merger in {{nfly|1970}}, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XX]]; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the {{nfly|1985}} season, but after winning road playoff games against the [[New York Jets]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager [[John Elway]] simply stated, "We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms"; they previously had been {{Win loss record|w=0|l=4}} in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swanson|first=Ben|title=Broncos to wear white uniforms in Super Bowl 50|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|publisher=Denver Broncos|date=January 25, 2016|accessdate=January 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222617/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Broncos choose to wear white jerseys in Super Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000628505/article/broncos-choose-to-wear-white-jerseys-in-super-bowl|publisher=National Football League|date=January 25, 2016|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of [[Bill Belichick]] and [[Tom Brady]], New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the {{nfly|2008}}, {{nfly|2010}}, and {{nfly|2011}} seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=White at Home in the NFL|url=https://uni-watch.com/research-projects/white-at-home-in-the-nfl/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New England Patriots were 3–0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls prior to Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Oliver |title='Attention to detail is everything' to Bill Belichick |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/attention-to-detail-is-everything-to-bill-belichick/ |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |title=Why the Patriots wore white at home |url=http://www.espn.com/blog/boston/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4683236/why-the-patriots-wore-white-at-home |website=ESPN.com |language=en |date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Rich |title=Patriots to wear their white jerseys in Super Bowl LII |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2018/1/23/16921342/super-bowl-lii-new-england-patriots-white-jerseys-against-philadelphia-eagles-designated-home-team |website=Pats Pulpit |date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patriots To Wear White Jerseys In Super Bowl LII, Despite Being 'Home Team' |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/23/patriots-white-jerseys-super-bowl-lii-eagles/ |website=boston.cbslocal.com |language=en |date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jr |first1=Harry Lyles |title=The Patriots are trying to win the Super Bowl by strategic jersey selection |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/1/23/16923176/super-bowl-52-patriots-eagles-jerseys-home-away |website=SBNation.com |date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; White-shirted teams have won 33 of 52 Super Bowls to date (63%). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Green Bay Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers in [[Super Bowl XLV]] and the Philadelphia Eagles against the New England Patriots in [[Super Bowl LII]], with teams in white winning 12 of the last 14 Super Bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Cody|title=Super Bowl 2018 jerseys: Patriots hope white stays lucky, Eagles will wear green|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/super-bowl-2018-jerseys-patriots-hope-white-stays-lucky-eagles-will-wear-green/|accessdate=February 21, 2018|publisher=CBS Sports|date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1955 [[throwback uniform]] in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], which for that year was their regular home jersey. The Los Angeles Rams in [[Super Bowl LIII]] wore their royal blue and yellow throwback uniforms, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Cody|title=2019 Super Bowl jerseys: Los Angeles Rams to wear blue and yellow throwback uniforms|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2019-super-bowl-jerseys-los-angeles-rams-to-wear-blue-and-yellow-throwback-uniforms/|publisher=CBS Sports|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=January 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; No team has yet worn a [[third jersey]] or [[Color Rush]] uniform for the Super Bowl.

The game has never been played in a region that lacked an NFL or AFL franchise,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} though [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] has occasionally been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31751_162-57369004-10391697/super-bowl-in-london-its-possible-owner-says/ | title=Super Bowl in London?

Seven stadiums that had hosted a Super Bowl game are no longer standing. [[Tulane Stadium]], which hosted three Super Bowls (it took on [[Super Bowl IX]] due to construction delays with its successor and original host, the [[Louisiana Superdome]]) was demolished in November 1979; [[Tampa Stadium]], which hosted two Super Bowls, was demolished in April 1999; [[Stanford Stadium]], which hosted one Super Bowl, was demolished and redeveloped in 2005&amp;ndash;06; the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], which hosted five Super Bowls, was demolished in May 2008; the [[Hubert H.

=={{anchor|NFL trademark issues}} Super Bowl trademark==
The NFL is very active on stopping what it says is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms "NFL", "Super Bowl", and "[[Super Bowl Sunday|Super Sunday]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipbrief.net/2014/01/27/the-super-trademark-bowl/|title=The Super – Trademark – Bowl|first1=Ali Toumadj / January|last1=27|first2=2014 / Comments Off on The Super-Trademark – Bowl / Daily|last2=Blog|last3=Trademark|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with euphemisms such as "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporteresq.com/thresq/ip/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538980 |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |date=January 29, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter, Esq. |title=Super Bowl, Super Trademarks: Protecting the NFL's IP |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701050745/http://www.hollywoodreporteresq.com/thresq/ip/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003538980 |archivedate=July 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicole |last=Norfleet |date=September 23, 2017 |url=http://www.startribune.com/be-careful-with-the-phrase-super-bowl-in-marketing-campaigns-nfl-has-the-trademark/446916483/ |title=Be careful with the phrase 'Super Bowl' in marketing; NFL has the trademark |newspaper=Star Tribune |access-date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radio spot for [[Planters]] nuts parodied this, by saying "it would be ''super''{{nbsp}}... to have a ''bowl''{{nbsp}}... of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" and comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] began referring to the game in 2014 as the "Superb Owl". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for "Superb Owl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91222783&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=1|title=USPTO TTABVUE. Proceeding Number 91222783}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL claims that the use of the phrase "Super Bowl" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news

In 2004, the NFL started issuing Cease and Desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. "Super Bowl" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as "Big Game Parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linshi|first1=Jack|title=Here's Why Companies Can't Say "Super Bowl" in their Super Bowl Ads|url=http://time.com/3674416/super-bowl-nfl-copyright-ads/|website=Time.com|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benston|first1=Liz|title=NFL's Letters May Spell Trouble For Casino Parties|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/feb/02/nfls-letters-may-spell-trouble-for-casino-parties/|website=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ordine|first1=Bill|title="Big Game" is Name in Vegas|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-02-05/sports/0602040263_1_las-vegas-vegas-hilton-bowl-parties|website=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NFL made an attempt to trademark "The Big Game" as well; however, it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public-relations opposition to the move, mostly from [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and their fans, as the [[Stanford Cardinal football]] and [[California Golden Bears football]] teams compete in the ''[[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]]'', which has been played since 1892 (28 years before the formation of the NFL and 75 years before [[Super Bowl I]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/23/SPGUAQ07LN6.DTL | title=NFL sidelines its pursuit of Big Game trademark | first=Tom | last=FitzGerald | date=May 23, 2007 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Mega millions lottery#The Big Game|Mega Millions]] lottery game was known as ''The Big Game'' (then ''The Big Game Mega Millions'') from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.megamillions.com/about/history.asp | title=Mega Millions Official Home | accessdate=January 21, 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121125603/http://www.megamillions.com/about/history.asp | archivedate=January 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the phrase "world champions"==
{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada#Use of the phrase "world champions"}}
Like the other major professional leagues in the United States, the winner of the Super Bowl is usually declared "world champion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells |first=Steven |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/18/american-sports-nfl-nba-mlb?view=desktop |title=US sport: Steven Wells on why NBA, MLB and NFL winners call themselves world champions, even though no one else takes part &amp;#124; Sport |work=The Guardian |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Simon |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/03/us-nfl-superbowl-world-idUSTRE71295820110203 |title=Super Bowl contenders happy with world champions title |agency=Reuters |date= February 3, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice by the U.S. major leagues of using the "World Champion" moniker originates from the [[World Series]] of major league [[baseball]],{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and it was later used during the first three Super Bowls when they were referred to as AFL-NFL World Championship Games. The phrase is still engraved on the [[Super Bowl ring]]s.
