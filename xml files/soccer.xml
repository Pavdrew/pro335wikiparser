MLS teams also play in other international and domestic competitions. Every year, five MLS teams — four from the U.S. and one from Canada — play in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] against other clubs from the [[CONCACAF]] region (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based on MLS regular-season results: the winner of the Western conference and the winner of the Eastern conference. The third U.S. team to qualify is the winner of the [[MLS Cup]]. A fourth U.S.-based MLS team can qualify via the [[U.S. Open Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/lamar-hunt-us-open-cup|title=Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920220525/http://www.ussoccer.com/lamar-hunt-us-open-cup|archivedate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the MLS berths are taken by a Canada-based MLS team, the berth is reallocated to the best U.S.-based team in the Supporters' Shield table that has otherwise not qualified.

Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national [[soccer]] leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html|title=By The Numbers… North American Soccer League vs Major League Soccer|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212061104/http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html|archivedate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[U.S. Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.&lt;ref name="leagle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/200022797FSupp2d130_1215|title=FRASER v.

MLS began play in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] with ten teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]] defeated [[D.C. United]] before 31,000 fans at [[CEFCU Stadium|Spartan Stadium]] in San Jose in a game broadcast on ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/04/9/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/MLS-KICKS-OFF-TO-FESTIVE-CROWD-MIXED-ON-FIELD-REVIEWS.aspx?hl=MLS&amp;sc=0|title=MLS KICKS OFF TO FESTIVE CROWD, MIXED ON-FIELD REVIEWS|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403003646/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/04/9/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/MLS-KICKS-OFF-TO-FESTIVE-CROWD-MIXED-ON-FIELD-REVIEWS.aspx?hl=MLS&amp;sc=0|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS—including U.S. stars such as [[Alexi Lalas]], [[Tony Meola]] and [[Eric Wynalda]], and foreign players such as Mexico's [[Jorge Campos]] and Colombia's [[Carlos Valderrama]].&lt;ref&gt;"19 Teams with 1 Goal: A Spotlight on Major League Soccer", June 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
D.C. United won the [[MLS Cup]] in three of the league's first four seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcunited.com/club/trophy-case|title=Trophy Case|work=D.C.

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/|title=Resurgence and Expansion of the MLS|work=Soccer Politics / The Politics of Football|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209173530/https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/|archivedate=December 9, 2014|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large [[American football]] stadiums.&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;
One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to "Americanize" the sport. The league implemented the use of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootouts]] to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/1999/11/18/wednesday_teleconference/|title=Shootout banned; TV lineup changed|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221144053/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/1999/11/18/wednesday_teleconference/|archivedate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's quality was cast into doubt when the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national team]], which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;

Major League Soccer lost an estimated $250&amp;nbsp;million during its first five years, and more than $350&amp;nbsp;million between its founding and 2004.&lt;ref name=profit&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Stanley |title=Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=November 22, 2004 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer:%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628194808/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer%3A%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html |title=For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder |work=The New York Times |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220211629/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html |archivedate=December 20, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|title=MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115539/http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|title=MLS considering weight-loss program|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211173513/http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|archivedate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's financial problems led to Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] being replaced by [[Don Garber]], a former NFL executive, in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan|title=Mls Boots Commissioner, Turns To Nfl For Successor|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505072549/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan|archivedate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following decreased attendance and increased losses by late 2001, league officials planned to fold but were able to secure new financing from owners [[Lamar Hunt]], [[Philip Anschutz]], and the [[Kraft Group|Kraft family]] to take on more teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Kevin |date=December 5, 2015 |title=MLS goes from near extinction to remarkable success |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-soccer-baxter-20151206-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion]], leaving the league with ten teams.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/01/05/throw-did-eliminating-tampa-miami-save-mls|title=The Throw-In: Did eliminating Tampa, Miami save MLS?|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918025920/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/01/05/throw-did-eliminating-tampa-miami-save-mls|archivedate=September 18, 2014|date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the league's resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as [[Mapfre Stadium]], was built in 1999, becoming MLS's first [[soccer-specific stadium]].&lt;ref name="Columbus Crew history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/columbus|title=Columbus Crew history|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030033126/http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/columbus|archivedate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3476449|title=Making Soccer 'Major League' in the USA and Beyond:Major League Soccer's First Decade|journal=Sport History Review|volume=45|issue=1|pages=23–36|accessdate=September 20, 2014|last1=Club|first1=Tennessee Smokies Baseball|last2=Nauright|first2=John|last3=Parrish|first3=Charles|last4=Strutner|first4=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS's policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', 97 F.Supp.2d 130 ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|D. Mass]] 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence===
The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], in which the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] unexpectedly made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS.&lt;ref name="nycfc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycfc.com/Fans/Learn-about-MLS |title=Learn about MLS |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720230433/http://www.nycfc.com/fans/learn-about-mls |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |publisher=New York City FC |accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MLS Cup 2002]] drew 61,316 spectators to [[Gillette Stadium]], the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final until [[2018 MLS Cup|2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |title=MLS Cup 2002 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516201220/http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |archivedate=May 16, 2013  |date=October 20, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) rules in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exittheforest.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/formatting-mls-part-4-global-tradition-american-appeal/|title=Formatting MLS, Part 4: Global Tradition, American Appeal|work=Waldlichtung|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814155539/http://exittheforest.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/formatting-mls-part-4-global-tradition-american-appeal/|archivedate=August 14, 2014|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, [[Tim Howard]] was transferred to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yanks-abroad.com/content.php?mode=players&amp;id=11|title=Tim Howard club career|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008055145/http://www.yanks-abroad.com/content.php?mode=players&amp;id=11|archivedate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=March 24, 2015 |title=Americans in the Premier League -- why have numbers dropped recently? |url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2331121/americans-in-the-premier-league----why-have-numbers-dropped-recently |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202013152/http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2331121/americans-in-the-premier-league----why-have-numbers-dropped-recently |archivedate=February 2, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6435726/rsl-jason-kreis-to-prove|title=Jason Kreis still has something to prove|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224105448/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6435726/rsl-jason-kreis-to-prove|archivedate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Chivas USA]] began play in [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]], with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2012/9/27/3415314/real-salt-lake-vs-chivas-usa-expansion-rivalry-a-history-lesson|title=Real Salt Lake vs. Chivas USA – Expansion rivalry a history lesson|date=September 28, 2012|work=RSL Soapbox|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043328/http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2012/9/27/3415314/real-salt-lake-vs-chivas-usa-expansion-rivalry-a-history-lesson|archivedate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion [[Houston Dynamo]], after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/history#2006|title=Quakes History|work=San Jose Earthquakes|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923142115/http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/history#2006|archivedate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Designated Players===
[[File:Red Bull Arena on the First Day.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New York Red Bulls' soccer-specific stadium, [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]].]]
In 2007 the league expanded beyond the United States' borders into Canada with the [[Toronto FC]] expansion team.&lt;ref name=Expansion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timbers.com/news/2010/11/mls-101-mls-expansion-draft-and-allocation-money|title=MLS 101: MLS Expansion Draft and Allocation Money|work=Portland Timbers|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213229/http://www.timbers.com/news/2010/11/mls-101-mls-expansion-draft-and-allocation-money|archivedate=August 12, 2014|date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the [[Designated Player Rule]], which helped bring international stars into the league.&lt;ref name="forbes-2014-09"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2012/08/05/has-the-beckham-rule-worked-for-mls/ |title=Has The 'Beckham Rule' Worked For MLS? |date=August 5, 2012  |first=Bobby |last=McMahon |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924164245/http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2012/08/05/has-the-beckham-rule-worked-for-mls/ |archivedate=September 24, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 season]] witnessed the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]]. Beckham's signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as [[Cuauhtémoc Blanco]] (Chicago Fire) and [[Juan Pablo Ángel]] (New York Red Bulls), are some of the first Designated Players who made major contributions to their clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lalas |first=Greg |title=Foreign exchange program |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 17, 2007 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/greg_lalas/04/17/mls.signings/index.html |accessdate=April 22, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421234847/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/greg_lalas/04/17/mls.signings/index.html |archivedate=April 21, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The departures of [[Clint Dempsey]] and [[Jozy Altidore]], coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars [[Claudio Reyna]] and [[Brian McBride]], highlighted the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbrfootball.com/a-brief-guide-to-major-league-soccer/|title=A brief guide to Major League Soccer|work=The Boot Room|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510025120/http://tbrfootball.com/a-brief-guide-to-major-league-soccer/|archivedate=May 10, 2015|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Ownership===
{{See also|Major League Soccer owners}}
Major League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business of Soccer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/2014/2/28/5456444/roundtable-is-mls-single-entity-here-to-stay|title=Roundtable: Is MLS Single Entity Here To Stay?|date=February 28, 2014|work=Hot Time in Old Town|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031111538/http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/2014/2/28/5456444/roundtable-is-mls-single-entity-here-to-stay|archivedate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/about-major-league-soccer |title=About Major League Soccer |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |quote=Major League Soccer is structured as a single, limited liability company (single-entity). In the single-entity business structure, club operators own a financial stake in the League, not just their individual team. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424164602/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/about-major-league-soccer |archivedate=April 24, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt; The court also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;

Having multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league's first ten years.&lt;ref name="latimes2006"/&gt; At one time [[Phil Anschutz]]'s AEG operated six MLS franchises and [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator.&lt;ref name="Contraction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season|title=Major League Soccer Announces Elimination of Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion for 2002 Season|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082916/http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season|archivedate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of [[Soccer United Marketing]], and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.&lt;ref name="Contraction"/&gt;

MLS salaries are limited by a [[Salary cap#Major League Soccer|salary cap]], which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.&lt;ref name="leagle.com"/&gt; The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'' lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team.&lt;ref name="Major League Soccer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pressbox2015/&gt;

Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two [[transfer window]]s—the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August.&lt;ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|title=Roster Rules and Regulations|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920193128/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|archivedate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2016/08/02/israeli-club-ups-offer-for-d-c-uniteds-steve-birnbaum-but/ |title=Israeli club ups offer for D.C.

MLS teams have a limited number of [[MLS International Roster Slots|international roster slots]] that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story|title=ASN article: MLS Allure: Why Wages Are Only Part of the Story|accessdate=September 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916192944/http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story|archivedate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers|title=Recent analysis of foreign player pool in MLS reveals interesting numbers|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912153409/http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers|archivedate=September 12, 2015|date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america|title=MLS remains most diverse professional sports league in North America|work=LA Galaxy|accessdate=April 24, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222317/http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america|archivedate=April 25, 2015|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Pat |title=MLS comes out of the gates strong in '07 |publisher=monstersandcritics.com |date=May 4, 2007 |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-mls/misc/mls_features_archive/mls_features_archive_050407.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524072946/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-mls%2Fmisc%2Fmls_features_archive%2Fmls_features_archive_050407.htm |archivedate=May 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

The [[Designated Player Rule|designated player (DP) rule]] allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap, each DP player only counts as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap in 2017. Instituted in 2007, England's [[David Beckham]] was the first signing under the DP rule.&lt;ref name="forbes-2014-09"/&gt; The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum.&lt;ref name="2014-salaries-mlsplayers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201,%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |title=2014 MLS Player Salaries: April 1, 2014: By Club |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |publisher=Major League Soccer Players Union |date=April 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618064130/http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201%2C%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |archivedate=June 18, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 season 21% of the league's wage spending went to just 5 players, this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |title=A Look at Income Inequality in MLS |work=Empire of Soccer |first=Bill |last=Reese |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726234141/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |archivedate=July 26, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |date=April 11, 2014 |first=Steve |last=Fenn |title=2014 MLS Salaries Visualized |publisher=StatHunting |accessdate=September 20, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712170437/http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |archivedate=July 12, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

MLS has introduced various initiatives and rules intended to develop young players. Rules concerning Generation Adidas players and home grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop and retain young players.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics.com"/&gt;

Players under the Home Grown Player rule are signed to Generation Adidas contracts,&lt;ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations"/&gt; all players on Generation Adidas contracts are "off budget players" and their salaries do not count against the cap.

MLS formerly operated a [[MLS Reserve League|reserve league]] that gave playing time to players who were not starters for their MLS teams. The Reserve League was formed in 2005, and operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 &amp; 2010 seasons).&lt;ref&gt;MLSsoccer.com, [http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commissioner-reveals-details-reserve-division "Commissioner reveals details of Reserve Division"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120213608/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commissioner-reveals-details-reserve-division |date=November 20, 2010 }}, November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as USL Pro in 2013,&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Deal"&gt;{{cite news |  url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/01/23/mls-usl-pro-reach-deal-restructured-reserve-league |  title=MLS, USL Pro reach deal on restructured Reserve League | work=MLSsoccer.com |  date=January 23, 2013 |  accessdate=January 27, 2013 |  url-status=live |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126060258/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/01/23/mls-usl-pro-reach-deal-restructured-reserve-league |  archivedate=January 26, 2013 |  df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, with MLS now requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or field their own reserve side in that league.

The development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress.  D.C. United had played their home games at former NFL and Major League Baseball venue [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017,  D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, [[Audi Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/soccer-insider/wp/2014/12/17/d-c-united-stadium-approval-improves-its-playing-field-in-mls-in-many-ways/ |title=D.C.

Two teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home games at [[Yankee Stadium]], a Major League Baseball venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the future. The New England Revolution play home games at a National Football League venue, [[Gillette Stadium]], but are currently in discussion with the City of [[Boston]] regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in [[South Boston]].&lt;ref name="Boston Globe 2014"&gt;''Boston Globe'',{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/18/krafts-exploring-soccer-stadium-boston/s7p5krvDeH1J7UgjlEIFtM/story.html |title=Kraft family looks to build soccer stadium in Boston |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121103133/http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/18/krafts-exploring-soccer-stadium-boston/s7p5krvDeH1J7UgjlEIFtM/story.html |archivedate=November 21, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders FC play at [[CenturyLink Field]], a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer.

Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS's financial security.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs.&lt;ref name="Forbes, Major League Soccer 2013"/&gt;

Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league's early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with [[ESPN]] spanning the 2007–2014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees, reported to be worth $7–8&amp;nbsp;million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2006/08/Issue-216/Sports-Media/ESPN-MLS-Reach-Eight-Year-TV-Deal-That-Includes-Rights-Fees.aspx|title=ESPN, MLS Reach Eight-Year TV Deal That Includes Rights Fees|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224183626/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2006/08/Issue-216/Sports-Media/ESPN-MLS-Reach-Eight-Year-TV-Deal-That-Includes-Rights-Fees.aspx|archivedate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media rights agency MP &amp; Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10&amp;nbsp;million annually.

In early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship deal with Adidas.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer.

By 2012 the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' published a report that revealed that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's collective annual revenues were $494&amp;nbsp;million, and that the league's collective annual profit was $34&amp;nbsp;million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to be worth $103&amp;nbsp;million on average, almost three times as much as the $37&amp;nbsp;million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175&amp;nbsp;million, a 483% gain over the $30&amp;nbsp;million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 ''Forbes'' updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million.&lt;ref name="forbes-2015-08"/&gt;

As of 2018 ''Forbes'' estimates Atlanta United FC are the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2018/11/14/mls-most-valuable-teams-2018/?src=rss|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams 2018: Atlanta United Debuts On Top
|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs.

MLS teams typically use commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four [[charter flight]]s allowed under league rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karstens-Smith |first=Gemma |date=April 26, 2019 |title=Montreal Impact, Vancouver Whitecaps voice concerns about Major League Soccer travel woes |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-montreal-impact-vancouver-whitecaps-voice-concerns-about-major-league/ |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules and officials===
MLS follows the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules and standards]] of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).
The playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] if necessary.

[[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league's "Game First" initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Game First' initiatives enhance on-field product |publisher=Major League Soccer Communications |date=April 2, 2007 |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&amp;content_id=87043&amp;vkey=pr_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |accessdate=May 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426134827/http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&amp;content_id=87043&amp;vkey=pr_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |archivedate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Major League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new rule was [[Charlie Davies]], fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|title=MLS Disciplinary Committee fines Davies for dive vs. RSL|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230231605/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|archivedate=December 30, 2014|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team names===
:''For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.''

In the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., [[Columbus Crew]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[New England Revolution]]). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] team names [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974–88)|San Jose Earthquakes]], [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]], [[Portland Timbers (1975–82)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974–84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346|title=Toye: Fans are delighted the old NASL names, Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps and Quakes were saved|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202155940/http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346|archivedate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN, FS1, and Univision share in coverage of the playoffs, while ABC and FOX alternate broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches are aired per-season across all three networks. The three contracts have an average estimated value of $90 million per season—five times larger than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, Univision, and [[NBC Sports]].&lt;ref name=philly-espnfs1mls&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC to end MLS deal in 2015; ESPN, Fox pay $70 million per year for new rights package|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/NBC-to-lose-MLS-rights-in-2015-ESPN-Fox-likely-to-share-new-deal.html|work=The Goalkeeper|accessdate=February 3, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114221044/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/NBC-to-lose-MLS-rights-in-2015-ESPN-Fox-likely-to-share-new-deal.html|archivedate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's more evidence that Americans are growing fond of soccer|url=http://qz.com/208672/heres-more-evidence-that-americans-are-growing-fond-of-soccer/#/h/68308,1/|accessdate=May 18, 2014|newspaper=Quartz|date=May 12, 2014|author=John McDuling|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517021121/http://qz.com/208672/heres-more-evidence-that-americans-are-growing-fond-of-soccer/#/h/68308,1/|archivedate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;&lt;ref name=sbj-bigplay&gt;{{cite web|title=MLS's big play|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx?_ga=1.45967076.1328930521.1404086578|work=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=June 30, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715015235/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx?_ga=1.45967076.1328930521.1404086578|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-newcontract&gt;{{cite news|title=M.L.S. and TV Networks Reach Deal to Set Weekly Slots for Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/sports/soccer/mls-and-tv-networks-reach-deal-to-set-weekly-slots-for-games.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513214511/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/sports/soccer/mls-and-tv-networks-reach-deal-to-set-weekly-slots-for-games.html?_r=0|archivedate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mls-newdeal2015&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN, Fox and Univision promise new emphasis to domestic game, MLS in landmark eight-year TV deal|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/05/12/espn-fox-and-univision-promise-new-emphasis-domestic-game-mls-landmark-eight|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=May 13, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513163155/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/05/12/espn-fox-and-univision-promise-new-emphasis-domestic-game-mls-landmark-eight|archivedate=May 13, 2014|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2011/08/23/2632284/business-off-the-pitch-breakdown-of-major-league-soccers|title=Business Off The Pitch: Breakdown of Major League Soccer's Broadcast Partners|work=Goal.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216190536/http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2011/08/23/2632284/business-off-the-pitch-breakdown-of-major-league-soccers|archivedate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matches not televised nationally are broadcast regionally, often by [[regional sports networks]] like [[Fox Sports Networks]], [[Comcast SportsNet]], [[Spectrum Sports]] and [[Root Sports]], and sometimes by terrestrial stations like [[KTXA]], [[WRDQ]] anad [[KMYU]].&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt; Regionally televised matches are available outside their local markets on [[ESPN+]].

Coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007 with the addition of Toronto FC.
Currently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are held by the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] networks through a five-year deal first renewed in 2017.

==MLS awards==
At the conclusion of each season, the league presents several awards for outstanding achievements, mostly to players, but also to coaches, referees, and teams. The finalists in each category are determined by voting from MLS players, team employees, and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/mls-announces-2013-awards-finalists|title=MLS Announces 2013 Awards Finalists|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903042624/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/mls-announces-2013-awards-finalists|archivedate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
