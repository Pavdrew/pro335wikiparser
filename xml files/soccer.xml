      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">In [[Major League Soccer]], in addition to the senior roster, each team can carry a '''developmental roster''' of a certain number of young players whose contracts do not count against the [[salary cap]].  The allowable size of developmental rosters has varied throughout its existence: in the 2005 season, it grew to ten from a former limit of six, but for the 2009 season, it was reduced to a limit of four players.

The developmental roster includes [[Generation adidas]] (known as ''Project-40'' before 2005) signees, '''Home-Grown Players,''' and other players (usually recent college graduates) 25 or younger, called '''developmental players'''. Except for the Generation adidas players, whose salaries have no limit and are negotiated individually with the league, developmental players are paid a salary well below the MLS minimum, currently pegged at around $32,504 per year.  A player is graduated from the developmental roster to the senior roster at the team's discretion, a decision which usually results from a player passing the age limit or becoming an important member of the squad.

Notable former developmental players include [[Davy Arnaud]], [[Nat Borchers]], [[Alejandro Moreno]], [[Jack Jewsbury]], [[Chris Wondolowski]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1177191/index.htm|title=Sports Illustrated Vault - 1950 Issues|website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Troy Perkins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">In [[Major League Soccer]], '''allocation money''' represents an amount of money teams can use to sign players and/or allocate to their salaries to get under the [[salary cap]].

==Obtaining allocation money==
MLS teams receive general allocation money for these reasons:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mlsplayers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collective-Bargaining-Agreement-February-1-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214124728/https://mlsplayers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collective-Bargaining-Agreement-February-1-2015.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# End-of-season allocation of $200,000 for each team that does not make the [[MLS Cup Playoffs|post season]] (CBA section 10.17 &amp; roster rules)
# Expansion year allocation of $1.1 million for each expansion team (CBA section 10.18a)
# Expansion year allocation of $100,000 for each existing team (CBA section 10.18b)
# Annual allocation of $200,000 for each team (CBA section 10.19a)
# Qualification for the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] allocation of $140,000 for each qualified team (roster rules)
# Transfer or loan of player to another club outside of MLS allocation of up to $750,000 for each transfer or loan (CBA section 10.19e &amp; roster rules)
# Third [[Designated Player Rule|Designated Player]] charge distribution (CBA section 10.19f)
# Free agency compensation of $50,000 per net player loss (CBA section 29.7b)
# [[2017 MLS Expansion Draft|Expansion Draft]] compensation of $50,000 for each player selected&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/mls-2017-expansion-draft-lafc-the-argument-against-allocation-instead&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS teams receive targeted allocation money for these reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mlsplayers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collective-Bargaining-Agreement-February-1-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214124728/https://mlsplayers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collective-Bargaining-Agreement-February-1-2015.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Annual allocation of $100,000 for each team (CBA section 10.19b)
# December 2016 announcement of $1.2 million of additional targeted allocation money for each team&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/12/09/mls-announces-increase-targeted-allocation-money-2017&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teams may also pull forward and use immediately the $100,000 of targeted allocation money and $1.2 million of additional targeted allocation money designated for 2019
# December 2017 announcement of up to $2.8 million of team-funded targeted allocation money for each team&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/12/08/mls-announces-increase-targeted-allocation-money-2018-and-2019&lt;/ref&gt;

All numbers are for [[2018 Major League Soccer season|2018 season]].

==Uses==
General allocation money can be used in several ways:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduce the amount that a non-Designated Player costs against the salary cap down to the league minimum salary ($67,500 in 2018).
* Reduce the amount that a Designated Player costs against the salary cap down to $150,000.
* Sign players new to MLS.
* Re-sign an existing MLS player.
* Off-set acquisition cost (loan and transfer fees).
* In connection with the extension of a player's contract for the second year provided the player was new to MLS in the immediately prior year.
* Trade it to another team.

General allocation money must be used within 30 days of the close of the third full MLS transfer window after it was acquired. If a quantity of general allocation money is not used within that timeframe, it is halved by the league. That halved amount is then available for use during the next two transfer windows. If it is still not used after those transfer windows, the quantity is no longer available for use.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/05/04/stejskal-where-and-how-johannsson-might-wind-mls-duka-move&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted allocation money can be used in several ways:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sign new or re-sign existing players whose salary and acquisition costs are more than the maximum salary budget charge ($504,375 in 2018) up to $1.5 million.
* Convert a Designated Player to a non-Designated Player by buying down his salary budget charge to below the maximum salary budget charge provided the club then signs a new Designated Player at an investment equal to or greater than the player he is replacing.
* Sign new [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|homegrown players]] to their first MLS contract using up to $200,000 of targeted allocation money.
* Trade league-funded targeted allocation money to another team.

Targeted allocation money must be applied, if not necessarily used, within four MLS transfer windows of its acquisition. In this case, "applied" does not mean a team actually has to use the amount within four windows. Rather, they merely have to notify the league of how they plan on using their expiring targeted allocation money – allocating a specific amount to a specific player – in the following window by the end of the fourth window after it was acquired. If they do not do that, that amount expires.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/05/04/stejskal-where-and-how-johannsson-might-wind-mls-duka-move&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted allocation money and general allocation money may not be used in combination when signing or re-signing a player. Either targeted allocation money or general allocation money may be used on a player in a single season, not both.

Amounts of allocation money held by each team are not disclosed to the general public. Only in the case of a trade will the amount of allocation money involved be made public.

Twice in league history, an allocation received for a lost player was used on the same player upon his return to the league: by the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] on [[Ante Razov]] and by the [[New England Revolution]] on [[Daniel Hernández (soccer)|Daniel Hernandez]].

==Other allocations==
Allocation money is not to be confused with the MLS Allocation Order, which is a ranking used to determine which MLS club has first priority to acquire a player who is in MLS allocation list. MLS allocation list contains select [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. National Team]] players and players transferred outside of MLS garnering transfer fee of at least $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/allocation&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Allocation Money, Allocation Order rankings can be traded, provided that part of the compensation received in return is another club's Allocation ranking.

The '''Designated Player Rule''', nicknamed the '''Beckham Rule''',&lt;ref name="HollywoodEnding"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2011/11/28/106135817/hollywood-ending|title=Hollywood Ending: If this was indeed David Beckham's final game in MLS, he went out in style, carrying the Galaxy to a championship and affirming the value of star power in America|last=Wahl|first=Grant|date=November 28, 2011|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=November 25, 2011|quote=In the first four seasons of MLS's Beckham Rule, which allowed clubs to sign up to three designated players outside the salary cap, ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted as part of the [[salary cap]] regulations of [[Major League Soccer]] for the 2007 season.  The rule allows each MLS franchise to sign up to three players that would be considered outside the team's salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player), allowing MLS teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market. Clubs have the option to use allocation money against a player's contract, so as to avoid a player with a Designated Player level salary using one of the club's Designated Player slots. As of December 2015, there have been 114 designated players in the MLS.

The rule is informally named after &lt;!--(Beckham is an English midfielder)--&gt;[[David Beckham]], in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players of Beckham's caliber.&lt;ref name=HollywoodEnding/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lansley, Pete"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060413/asp/sports/story_6093255.asp|title=Becks could be the next American idol|work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=December 1, 2007|date=April 13, 2007|author=Lansley, Pete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] with a guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.&lt;ref name="PlayersUnion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html |title=PlayersUnion |publisher=Mlsplayers.org |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511125731/http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html |archive-date=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckham hopes to make US history"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6256125.stm|title=Beckham hopes to make US history|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=December 1, 2007 | date=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The team salary cap was estimated to be around [[United States dollar|US$]]1.9 million in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/26/AR2006042602276.html|title=Palencia Has Richest MLS Salary|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 1, 2007|date=April 26, 2006|author=Goff, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; was $2.1 million in 2007, and was raised to $2.3 million for the 2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=article.main&amp;articleId=57143&amp;requestTimeout=900|title=Debate highlights MLS salary cap split|work=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=December 1, 2007|date=November 26, 2007|author=Mickle, Tripp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytdp09&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/sports/soccer/18soccer.html?ref=soccer|title=In M.L.S., Designated Players Do Not Guarantee Great Expectations|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 18, 2009|date=March 18, 2009|author=Bell, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the 2010 Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLS and the MLS Players' Union, the 2010 salary cap was $2.55 million, with an automatic five percent increase each year until the expiration of the agreement at the end of the 2014 season.

Under the 2007 rule:
*The rule expires at the end of the 2009 season, and must be renewed then or allowed to lapse.
*For each Designated Player, $400,000&lt;ref name=nytdp09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/soccer_america/02/24/aeg.beckham/ | publisher=CNN | title=Galaxy, Milan, Inter wait on Becks | date=February 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his salary is charged to the salary cap and paid by the league, with any remaining salary being paid by the team's owner.  This value was increased for the 2009 season to $415,000.
*Prior to the 2007 season, there were three players whose salary exceeded $400,000.  These players were [[Landon Donovan]], [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]] and [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer)|Eddie Johnson]].  According to the rule, these players were [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in for the 2007 season, and the exemption was extended after the 2007 season, with the league planning to review the issue at a future date.  It was possible that the league would be required to renegotiate these players' contracts or consider them Designated Players.  However, prior to the start of the 2008 season, Johnson moved to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] of the [[Premier League]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; while following [[Dwayne De Rosario]]'s signing by Toronto FC in January 2009, Ruiz was released by the club and left MLS to play for [[Olimpia Asunción]].  This left Donovan as the lone player whose 2009 salary remained grandfathered under the exemption provision. However, there were several more players whose guaranteed salary exceeded the Designated Player amount, but whose salary cap expense was actually lower than their true salary due to the [[Allocation (MLS)|allocation rule]].  These players include [[Shalrie Joseph]] ($450,000), [[Christian Gomez]] ($430,000), Dwayne De Rosario ($425,750), and [[Taylor Twellman]] ($420,000).
*Each team initially had one Designated Player spot, but could trade their Designated Spot to another team; teams were allowed a maximum of two Designated Players.
*Only $325,000 of a team's second Designated Player counted against the salary cap, which was increased to $335,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name=nytdp09 /&gt;

The 2010 changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2011498898_major_league_soccer_adds_secon.html#continue |title=Major League Soccer adds second DP slot, can purchase a third (league release) |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=April 1, 2010 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The rule has no expiration date.
*For each Designated Player, $335,000 of his salary is charged to the salary cap and paid by the league ($167,500 for DP players joining during the MLS summer transfer window), with any remaining salary being paid by the team's owner.  This amount is halved for Designated Players signed in the middle of the season.  The salary cap value of Designated Players can also be reduced using allocation money.  Finally, teams whose Designated Players transfer abroad in the middle of a season can recoup part of the Designated Players' salary cap value.
*Landon Donovan is no longer grandfathered into the rule and must be considered a Designated Player.
*Each team is allowed two Designated Player spots, and they can no longer trade their Designated Player spots.  The [[New York Red Bulls]] will receive $70,000 in allocation money in return for the nullification of their 2007 trade with [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] for an additional Designated Player spot.  This means that both New York and Chivas USA will have two Designated Player spots for the 2010 season.
*Teams can pay a $250,000 "luxury tax" for the right to sign a third Designated Player.  This $250,000 would be distributed equally to all MLS teams that have not signed a third Designated Player in the form of [[Allocation (MLS)|allocation money]].

The 2012 changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |title=2012 MLS Roster Rules |work=mlssocer.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005943/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 2012 season, the rule was changed with respect to younger players. MLS announced the changes in August 2011 after clubs expressed concern about signing young international players with no guarantees that they would develop into stars.

* Designated Players over the age of 23 will carry a salary budget charge of $350,000, unless the player joins his club in the middle of the season, in which case his budget charge will be $175,000.
* Designated Players 21–23 years old count as $200,000 against the club's salary budget.
* Designated Players 20 years old or younger count as $150,000 against the club's salary budget.
* The budget charge for the midseason signing of a young Designated Player (23 years old and younger) is $150,000 and this amount cannot be lowered with allocation funds. 
* Clubs will not have to buy the third DP roster slot to accommodate Designated Players 23 years old and younger.
* Age of player is determined by year (not date) of birth.

The maximum budget charge for Designated Players over age 23 was increased to $368,750 for 2013, $387,500 in 2014, $436,250 in 2015, $457,500 in 2016, and $480,625 in 2017. The budget charge for those who join during the midseason transfer window has remained at one-half of the full-season cap charge since the inception of the rule. The budget charges for younger players have not changed since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations |title=Roster Rules and Regulations |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''
* Chart indicates when players signed their current Designated Player contract, not necessarily their first year in MLS.
* Other players in MLS may also be paid a salary that takes them above the Designated Player threshold, but they have had their salary reduced against the salary cap using General or Targeted Allocation Money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations#targeted-allocation-money|title=MLS Roster Rules and Regulations - MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Player salaries may be below the Designated Player threshold, but their transfer fee maybe mean the total compensation takes them above the threshold.
* Player salaries include compensation from their MLS contract, not including any bonuses or compensation from contracts with individual teams or their affiliates.

==Club DP history==

'''Notes'''
* The below list indicates players who have had their contract assigned as a Designated Player (DP) contract during their time in MLS. Players may have not always have had a DP contract, or have later had their contract negotiated below a DP level. Similarly, some players have been in MLS whose salary has been at a DP level, but the club has opted to bring their salary below the DP threshold using General Allocation Money or Targeted Allocation Money. Their listed "Years as DP" indicates what seasons they were active as a DP for that club only. Players in '''bold''' are currently signed to a DP contract by their club.
* Former MLS sides [[Miami Fusion]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were dissolved before the introduction of the Designated Player Rule.

==Western Conference playoff champions by year==
Note: The Conference finals were a best-of-three series through 2001 (including the MLS semifinals in 2000 and 2001, when a conference playoff format was not used). Matches tied after regulation were decided by a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootout]]. In 2002, a similar format was used except that draws were allowed and the team earning the most points advanced. From 2003 through 2011, the finals were a single match. Matches tied after regulation moved to [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] ([[Golden goal]] extra time was implemented for 2003 only), then a shootout if necessary. Beginning in 2012, the finals were a [[Two-legged tie|two-match aggregate series]]. The [[away goals]] rule for series that finished even on aggregate was first implemented in 2014. Extra time and shootouts were used if necessary. In 2019, the playoffs returned to a single match, single elimination format, including the conference finals which were hosted by the highest placed teams in the regular season.

'''Generation Adidas''' is a joint venture between [[Major League Soccer]] and [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] aimed at raising the level of young professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] talent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/354854/us-u-20-players-headline-2006-class|title=U.S. U-20 players headline 2006 class|author=|date=|website=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, sponsored by [[Adidas]], offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the [[MLS SuperDraft]] early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ussoccerplayers.com/2010/01/mccabe-explains-generation-adidas.html|title=McCabe Explains Generation adidas|author=|date=|website=US Soccer Players}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and was called '''Project-40'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/resource_center/soccer_history/447766.html|title=US Soccer Players|author=|date=|website=www.ussoccerplayers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry.

[[Carlos Parra]] was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as [[Tim Howard]], [[DaMarcus Beasley]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Ben Olsen]], [[Sacha Kljestan]], [[Freddy Adu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]], [[Nick Rimando]] and [[Kyle Beckerman]]. 

Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as [[professional]], and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out.

From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the [[USL First Division|A-League]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]].

In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/04/mls-announces-2017-generation-adidas-class-and-senior-signings&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the MLS-hosted series|the 1991–1994 series of international games|World Series of Soccer|the American football tournament|World Series of Football (1902–03)}}
The '''World Series of Soccer''' was a series of club games hosted by [[Major League Soccer]] from 2005 to 2007. It was used by MLS to provide its teams with opportunities to compete against top international teams.

==Previous uses of name==
The term, [[World Series of Soccer]], was originally used for a series of senior international soccer matches hosted by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] between 1991 and 1994. In 2005, [[Major League Soccer]] re-introduced the name for a series of professional matches in the United States

==2005==
In 2005, [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) began the '''World Series of Soccer''' (WSS), a series of games pitting MLS and big name international clubs against each other. The games took place across the United States. The WSS was a round robin style competition between two MLS teams: [[D.C. United]] and [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] as well as two European power houses: [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] of the English [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] of Italy's [[Serie A]]. The games were played during the MLS season, the European off-season.

===Results===
July 24  [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 0–1 [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]

July 27  [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] 1–3 [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]

July 28  [[D.C. United]] 1–2 [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]

July 31 [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 1–1 [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]

==2006==
In 2006, MLS continued the WSS and expanded it to include Real Madrid and Barcelona from Spain, Celtic from Scotland, Everton from England and Club América, Necaxa and Tigres from Mexico. 

===Results===
July 12  [[D.C. United]] 4–0 [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] (Scotland)

July 12  [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] 1–2 [[Club América]] (Mexico)

July 12  [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] 0–1 [[Necaxa]] (Mexico)

August 12  [[Red Bull New York|New York Red Bulls]] 1–4 [[FC Barcelona]] (Spain)

August 12 [[Real Salt Lake]] 0–2 [[Real Madrid]] (Spain)

==2007==
The World Series of Soccer returned in [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]] as a four-team affair, primarily used to promote the arrival of English footballer [[David Beckham]] to the United States. His [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] had a round-robin with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] of the [[Premier League]], the [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]] of the [[K League]], and the [[UANL Tigres]] of the [[Primera División de México]]. UANL Tigres won the competition by virtue of goal difference over Chelsea.

==Eastern Conference Playoff champions by year==
Note: The Conference finals were a best-of-three series through 2001 (including the MLS semifinals in 2000 and 2001, when a conference playoff format was not used). Matches tied after regulation were decided by a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootout]]. In 2002, a similar format was used except that draws were allowed and the team earning the most points advanced. From 2003 through 2011, the finals were a single match. Matches tied after regulation moved to [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] ([[Golden goal]] extra time was implemented for 2003 only), then a shootout if necessary. Beginning in 2012, the finals were a [[Two-legged tie|two-match aggregate series]]. The [[away goals]] rule for series that finished even on aggregate was first implemented in 2014. Extra time and shootouts are used if necessary. In 2019, the final returned to a single match format, hosted by the highest ranked team through the regular season.

;Notes
Some clubs have attendances over 100% capacity due to limited stadium capacity that is lifted during certain matches, when additional sections are opened. Other clubs use larger venues for certain matches that attract large attendances.&lt;!-- "Capacity" is the baseline, and cannot be over 100%. It is the actual attendance that we are measuring, and which can exceed 100% of capacity. --&gt;

Notes:
* Green shading indicates record highs; red shading indicates record lows.
* The drop in number of games and total attendance from 2000 to 2002, and the corresponding increase in average attendance, is attributable to league contraction, when MLS folded the [[Miami Fusion]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]].
* Several seasons saw increases in total attendance, despite drops in average attendance. One such case was due to expansion of the regular-season schedule; all others were due to [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|league expansion]].

==MLS attendance vs. other North American leagues==
The following table compares the Major League Soccer regular-season average attendance against the regular-season average attendance for the other professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada that have average attendances of at least 10,000 spectators per game.

Only attendances in MLS and the traditional major professional sports leagues of the U.S. and Canada are listed here. Many [[college football]] teams in MLS markets routinely outdraw MLS teams and even some or all other major professional teams.

'''[http://www.mlssoccer.com/topic/sue-o-mls Sueño MLS]''' is Major League Soccer’s premier national tryout looking for the next best young undiscovered soccer star. This program gives players the opportunity to be selected to join the elite Youth Academy System of a host Major League Soccer Club. 
Sueño MLS is a nationally-televised player search for [[Major League Soccer]]. Tryouts are held in three select cities every year on a first-come basis. Hundreds of teenagers passionate about soccer travel from across the country to attend the free tryouts.  Professional coaches from MLS teams are responsible for selecting the most talented players. 5 field players and 1 goalkeeper will be selected per participating city to compete for the National Sueno MLS title. 18 finalists train together for a few days to face in a final match against one of the MLS Academy Teams.

==History==
In 2011, 400 tryout spots were made available on the first day, and then the list of players was narrowed down to 30 for the second day of tryouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/sueno/about|title=About Sueño|work=MLSsoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five [[outfield]] players and 1 [[goalkeeper]] were selected from each city, namely [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and [[Philadelphia]].

The 2011 competition also included the first-ever award for the top goalkeeper of the competition titled the "Good Hands" Award.

The final was then held in [[Dallas, Texas]] where Birnis Adames was named the winner of the competition and Anthony Hall, the top goalkeeper, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/05/08/forward-birnis-adames-wins-sue%C3%B1o-mls-2011-%E2%80%93-presented-allstate|title=Forward Birnis Adames wins Sueño MLS 2011 – presented by Allstate|work=MLSsoccer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2017}}
Despite each receiving [[FIFA]]-affiliated status in 1913, both the [[Soccer in the United States|United States]] and [[Soccer in Canada|Canada]] have lacked a consistent, multi-division soccer system until recently. Consequently, the determination of champions has been problematic at times. The United States did not have a truly national top flight league until the FIFA-sanctioned [[United Soccer Association]] and the "outlaw" [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]], which had a network television contract, merged in November 1967 to form the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL). The NASL considered the two pre-merge forerunner leagues as part of its history.

Before 1967, there were several regional and city leagues of various levels of quality. For example, the first and second incarnations of the [[American Soccer League (1933–83)|American Soccer League]] constituted the premier level of professional soccer in the Northeastern United States, but they and teams from the [[St. Louis Soccer League]] would regularly defeat the best the other had to offer. These are only two of the most notable leagues of the regional era, as there were professional and amateur competitions in Chicago, California, the greater Western United States, Ontario, and Western Canada, among several other regions.

While the creation of the [[1968 North American Soccer League season|NASL in 1968]] brought bonafide top-flight competition to the U.S. and Canada, its collapse in [[1984 North American Soccer League season|1984]] saw a temporary return to the fragmented regional structure. The merger of the [[Western Soccer League]] and third iteration of the [[American Soccer League (1988–89)|American Soccer League]] created a national second division in the U.S. known as the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL) in 1990. The APSL later absorbed the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987–92)|Canadian Soccer League]], which at the time was an attempt at a wholly first division within Canada.

It was until not until the establishment of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] as part of FIFA's agreement to award the United States the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] that there was again a truly national, sanctioned first division in either country. Top Canadian teams resided at the second division until MLS expanded to Canada in [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]].

Given the tumultuous history of professional soccer in the United States and Canada, there is a broad history of champions of various kinds in both countries, both in leagues that comprised both nations and cups that were held in only one. This article takes into account all these competitions to compile an accurate listing of American and Canadian soccer champions with an eye towards maintaining continuity.

{{TOC limit|4}}

== Background ==

For teams in the United States and Canada, there are three major domestic trophies.&lt;ref name="majors"&gt;[http://thecup.us/other-us-opens-and-marketing-the-us-soccer-majors/ Marketing the US Soccer Majors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/soccer-almanac/news/article/2011/08/22/soccer-almanac-mls-trophy-case-infographic MLS Trophy Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary focus is the league championship, a postseason knockout tournament held between the best teams from the regular season. This is presently determined via the [[MLS Cup]]. American and Canadian sports leagues typically have such playoff systems. These have their roots in long travel distances common in U.S. and Canadian sports; to cut down on travel, leagues are typically aligned in geographic divisions and feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents in the same division. Due to the unbalanced schedule typical in U.S. and Canadian leagues, not all teams face the same opponents, and some teams may not meet an even number of times during a regular season, if at all. This results in teams with identical records that have faced different opponents differing numbers of times, making team records alone an imperfect measure of league supremacy. The playoffs allow for head-to-head elimination-style competition between teams to counterbalance this.

Secondary is the recognition of the best regular season record (an accomplishment known as the [[minor premiership|league premiership]] in Australia and New Zealand, countries with similar league structure to the U.S. and Canada).&lt;ref name="majors" /&gt; The MLS team with the highest point total during the regular season is awarded the [[Supporters' Shield]].

Thirdly, there are the two countries' respective domestic cup competitions: the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] and the [[Canadian Championship]]. These tournaments are unique to soccer among professional sports in the U.S. and Canada, as no other major team sport conducts competition outside of regular league play.

Additionally, American and Canadian clubs participate in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], a continental club competition in which the United States is allocated four qualification spots and Canada one. For American clubs, the winners of the MLS Cup, Supporters' Shield, and U.S. Open Cup all qualify, along with the regular season conference champion that does not win the Shield. The lone Canadian berth is determined by the Canadian Championship. Finally, there is the world championship as determined by the [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a berth to which is earned by winning the Champions League.

American and Canadian soccer clubs exist in a [[Professional sports league organization|franchise system]], rather than a [[promotion and relegation]] system. As a result, teams do not systematically move between levels each season. This is standard among American and Canadian major and minor sports leagues and is part of the franchise rights granted by the leagues. Recently, a trend has developed where a club from the lower divisions may be "promoted" via an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|expansion franchise]] awarded by Major League Soccer.

The results in this article come from the [[United States Soccer Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecup.us/category/history/ United States Soccer Federation – Open Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Soccer Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadasoccer.com/natchamps/competitions.asp Canadian Soccer Association – Competitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625092609/http://www.canadasoccer.com/natchamps/competitions.asp |date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/intro.html RSSSF – United States/Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Soccer History Archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/index.html American Soccer History Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|5|Note 5}} – Championship awarded to Paterson when Scullin were unable to field a team for the replay, due to injuries and players under baseball contracts beginning the baseball season&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|6|Note 6}} – Before the [[Spring 1931 American Soccer League|Spring 1931 season]], [[Fall River Marksmen]] moved to New York City and merged with [[New York Soccer Club]] to become the [[New York Yankees (soccer)|New York Yankees]]. However, they began the 1931 tournament under the name Fall River, and as such were required to play as Fall River for the remainder of it, and won the Cup. Before the [[Fall 1931 American Soccer League|Fall 1931 season]], the Yankees moved again, this time back north to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. They merged with [[Fall River F.C.]] to become the [[New Bedford Whalers]], and again won the Cup in 1932. The [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]] officially credits "Fall River Marksmen" with four championships in total, and "New Bedford Whalers" with one.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|7|Note 7}} – [[St. Louis Soccer League]] team names were determined by the club's respective corporate sponsor. The team known as '''[[Hellrungs]]''' from 1929 to 1931 was also known as '''Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.''' from 1931 to 1934, '''St. Louis Central Breweries F.C.''' from 1934 to 1935, and '''St. Louis Shamrocks''' from 1935 to 1938. As the change was only cosmetic and no relocations or mergers with clubs resulting in new rosters were made, the club's title history continues with the name changes.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|8|Note 8}} – Aggregate drawn 2–2, Championship shared when details for a third game could not be agreed upon.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|9|Note 9}} – '''[[Brooklyn Dodgers S.C.]]''' returned to their original name of '''Brooklyn Italians''' before the 1990s (the club states the change was in 1974, though later U.S. Open Cup tournaments have them registered under the Dodgers name).&lt;/small&gt;

=== Canadian National Championship ===

Though there were various levels of professional leagues in Canada throughout the 20th century, there was no multi-division cup for professional franchises that stretched from coast to coast until 2002. Even then, it was not until 2008 that this trophy was awarded via competition that was separate from regular season play. From 1913 to 2001, the highest national cup in Canada was in fact the amateur [[Canadian Challenge Cup|Challenge Trophy]], which still continues to this day after being replaced as the highest national cup competition in Canada by the professional Canadian Championship. The [[Open Canada Cup]] existed from 1998 to 2007, but excluded the premier professional clubs and was largely limited to the Ontario area.

* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|1|Note 1}} – If the full histories of the national championships were included, the table would be some 150 teams long and include dozens of defunct, historical, and strictly amateur (North American Division 4 or 5) squads. As North American Soccer League teams did not compete for the national championships, and for the sake of practicality, only the modern eras of the two national championship trophies (since 1995 for the U.S.'s [[Dewar Cup]] and since the inception of Canada's [[Voyageurs Cup]] in 2002) are included in this particular chart. For full national championship histories and totals, see below.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|2|Note 2}} – The current incarnation of the franchise is a namesake [[Phoenix club (association football)|phoenix club]] that owns the rights to the club's name and history.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{Note|3|Note 3}} – Team currently exists as a professional franchise in either the modern [[North American Soccer League]] (Division 2), the [[USL Championship]] (Division 2), or [[USL League One]] (Division 3), and as such are prevented from competing for two of the three domestic majors due to a lack of promotion and relegation.&lt;/small&gt;

==== Division 2 League Championship and Regular season ====

Before the 1976 season, the [[American Soccer League (1933–83)|American Soccer League]] placed its first teams on the west coast, going national. For the first time, the United States and Canada had a national-level second-division league. For 2017 the USSF granted provisional D2 status for both the NASL and the USL.

===== Western Soccer Alliance (1985–1989)/Lone Star Soccer Alliance (1987–1992)/American Soccer League III (1988–1989) =====

* In 1985, several independent teams on the west coast formed the Western Soccer Alliance.  Dedicated to fiscal austerity, it succeeded where the United Soccer League, founded the year before, failed.  In 1987, the Lone Star Soccer Alliance imitated the success of the WSA in creating a viable regional league.  In 1988, the third version of the American Soccer League, was established as a regional, east-coast league.

The '''Major League Soccer Player Combine''' is a four-day annual showcase, occurring every January. This year's combine will be held during January 11–17 and will take place in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orlando City Stadium]] where future [[Major League Soccer]] players perform physical and mental tests in front of coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the [[MLS SuperDraft]], the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Fans are allowed to attend all six matches for free.

== Format ==

The present Player Combine features four teams composed of invitees, usually who play on youth national teams or were standout players on premier college soccer teams.

== 2018 Combine Teams ==
* Team Tango (blue)
* Team Predator (red)
* Team X (white)
* Team Nemeziz (black)

==Caribbean expansion==
{{Main|MLS Caribbean Combine}}
In November 2013, the [[Caribbean Football Union]] and [[Major League Soccer]] came to an agreement where all 31 CFU members could put forward player candidates between the age of 18 and 22 to be entered into the combine. The Caribbean candidates would be vetted at a Caribbean combine event taking place in Antigua in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFU, MLS ink partnership agreement|url=http://www.concacaf.com/article/cfu-mls-ink-partnership-agreement|publisher=concacaf.com|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MLS International Roster Slots''' are an important piece of roster composition in [[Major League Soccer]]. MLS employs a variety of mechanisms to promote parity and domestic player development which include player entry drafts, expansion drafts, allocation drafts, weighted lotteries, and a limit on the number of international roster slots available for each team. The limit on the number of international roster slots makes each slot a valuable commodity for teams to utilize through player signings or trades with other teams.

The MLS roster rules for 2019 state:
* A total of 192 international roster slots are divided among the 24 teams. In 2008, each MLS team was given the right to have eight international players on its roster and each subsequent expansion teams were given the right to have eight international roster slots for its inaugural season. These roster slots are tradable, in full season increments, such that some teams may have more than eight and some teams may have fewer than eight. There is no limit on the number of international roster slots on each team's roster.
* For teams based in the United States, a domestic player is either:
** a U.S. citizen;
** a permanent resident (green card holder); or
** the holder of other special status (e.g., has been granted refugee or asylum status); or
** a player who qualifies under the Homegrown International Rule.
* For teams based in Canada, a domestic player is either:
** a Canadian citizen; or
** the holder of certain other special status (e.g., has been granted refugee or asylum status); or
** a player who qualifies under the Homegrown International Rule; or
** a U.S. Domestic Player.
* MLS teams based in Canada are required to have a minimum of three Canadian Domestic Players on their rosters.
* Homegrown International Rule: regardless of nationality, any player who meets the requirements to qualify as a [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|Homegrown Player]] as a member of an MLS team academy, either in the U.S. or Canada, or has met similar requirements as a member of a Canadian Approved Youth Club, will count as a domestic player on both U.S. and Canadian team rosters provided that:
** the player became a member of an MLS team academy, either in the U.S. or Canada, or a Canadian Approved Youth Club in the year prior to the year in which he turns 16; and
** the player signs his first professional contract with MLS or an MLS team's USL affiliate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23448">The '''Homegrown Player Rule''' is a [[Major League Soccer]] program that allows MLS teams to sign local players from their own development academies directly to MLS first team rosters. Before the creation of the rule in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2013-01-16/mls-draft-2013-fc-dallas-new-england-revolution-la-galaxy-schellas-hyndman-gyasi|work=Sporting News|title=MLS Draft 2013: Homegrown player initiative rises as draft declines}}&lt;/ref&gt; every player entering Major League Soccer would have to be assigned through one of the existing MLS player allocation processes, such as the [[MLS SuperDraft]].

MLS roster rules allow a team to sign players to contracts similar to [[Generation adidas]] contracts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |title=MLS 2012 Roster Rules |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005943/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which do not count against the MLS salary budget and may earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. MLS has since removed this wording from the roster rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|title=MLS 2015 Roster Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means homegrown players will not count against the salary budget only if they are registered using supplemental roster slots, but will still count against the salary budget if they are registered using senior roster slots. There is, however, supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/12/09/mls-announces-37-million-investment-targeted-allocation-money-homegrown-player-funds|title=MLS announces $37 million investment in Targeted Allocation Money, Homegrown Player funds for 2016-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To place a player on its homegrown player list, making him eligible to sign as a homegrown player, players must have resided in that club's home territory and participated in the club's youth development system for at least one year, as well as meeting other unspecified league requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |title=MLS 2012 Roster Rules |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005943/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a player on a team's homegrown list goes to college or U17, U20, and U23 [[United States men's national soccer team]]s, he remains eligible to sign as a homegrown player at any time as long as he is registered with the club as a homegrown player first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullsacademy.com/academy/overview/homegrown_player_policy.aspx|title=MLS Homegrown Player Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Seattle's [[DeAndre Yedlin]] became the first MLS Homegrown player to compete in a World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/worldcup/2023956614_bakersoccer30xml.html "Soccer in America: Plenty of growth, plenty more to go"], Seattle Times, June 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expansion of Major League Soccer''' has occurred several times since the league began play in 1996. [[Major League Soccer]] was established as the top level of professional [[Association football|soccer]] in the United States in 1993 with 10 teams and began play in 1996. It has expanded several times since 1998 into new markets across the United States and, since 2006, into Canada.

MLS is currently at 24 teams, when [[FC Cincinnati]] became the 24th team in 2019. The league plans to expand to 30 teams with the addition of [[Inter Miami CF]] and [[Nashville SC (MLS)|Nashville SC]] in 2020,&lt;ref name="Miami announcement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami MLS expansion team to begin play in 2020|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/01/29/miami-mls-expansion-team-begin-play-2020|website=MLSSoccer.com|publisher=MLS Digital|date=January 29, 2018|access-date=March 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austin FC]] in 2021,&lt;ref name="Austin FC announcement"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Austin FC to Begin Play in MLS in 2021|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/01/15/austin-fc-begin-play-mls-2021|website=MLSSoccer.com|publisher=MLS Digital|date=January 15, 2019|access-date=February 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Louis MLS team|St. Louis]] and [[Sacramento Republic FC (MLS)|Sacramento Republic FC]] in 2022, with the 30th team at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.stltoday.com/sports/soccer/st-louis-hailed-as-great-soccer-city-but-mls-vote/article_c2b23429-904a-5854-93a3-69c1f574c76b.html | title=St. Louis hailed as 'great soccer city,' but MLS vote on expansion is a ways off}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web | title=MLS announces plans to expand to 30 teams | work=MLSsoccer.com | date=April 18, 2019 | access-date=April 18, 2019 | url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/04/18/mls-announces-plans-expand-30-teams }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Expanding and establishing a larger national reach is seen as essential to securing television rights fees needed to reach MLS's stated goal of becoming one of the top leagues in the world by 2022.&lt;ref name="Straus April 2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccer.si.com/2014/04/16/mls-expansion-criteria-atlanta/2/|title=With Atlanta on board, MLS shows there's no one-size-fits-all expansion criteria|first=Brian|last=Straus|series=Planet Fútbol|work=Sports Illustrated|date=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100&amp;nbsp;million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Business of Soccer, NYCFC More About Major League Soccer Than New York, May 22, 2013, http://www.businessofsoccer.com/2013/05/22/nycfc-more-about-major-league-soccer-than-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt; This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of [[FC Cincinnati]] and a [[Nashville MLS team|new Nashville team]], which each paid $150&amp;nbsp;million to join MLS (FC Cincinnati in 2019 and Nashville in 2020).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savino |first=Christopher |url=http://www.businessofsoccer.com/2013/05/22/nycfc-more-about-major-league-soccer-than-new-york/ |title=NYCFC More About Major League Soccer Than New York |publisher=Business of Soccer |accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A Miami team announced in January 2018 and later unveiled as [[Inter Miami CF]] only paid a $25&amp;nbsp;million fee.

Major League Soccer considers several criteria when determining where to award expansion franchises:
* owners that are committed to MLS and have the financial wherewithal to invest in a team,
* a stadium or approved plans for a stadium (preferably a soccer-specific stadium) that allows the team to control revenue streams such as parking and concessions,
* the size of the market of the metropolitan area, and
* an established local fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/aug/03/piecing-the-puzzle-of-mls-expansion-picture-here/|title=Piecing the puzzle of MLS expansion picture here|date=August 3, 2010|work=U-T San Diego|first=Mark|last=Ziegler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/soccer/index.ssf/2011/06/with_eyes_on_detroit_silverdome_owners_submit_mls_expansion_bid.html|title=With eyes on Detroit, Silverdome owners submit Major League Soccer expansion bid|date=June 7, 2011 |publisher=MLive.com|first=Josh|last=Hakala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history: 1993–2003 ==
MLS expansion got off to a mixed start in its initial years. MLS began playing with 10 teams in 1996, grew to 12 teams in 1998, but put expansion plans on hold and then eliminated two teams following the 2001 season to return to 10 teams.

=== Foundation (1993–1996) ===
[[Major League Soccer]] was established in 1993, as part of an agreement with [[FIFA]] that the United States set up a professional first division to gain the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/soccerhistory.html |title=History of Association Football (Soccer) From Early Beginnings To Present |publisher=Thepeoplehistory.com |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No successful professional outdoor soccer league existed since the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] folded in 1985. Due to rapid over-expansion and poor franchise placement, the NASL collapse led future MLS leaders to be extremely cautious of establishing new franchises.

Initially twelve new teams were to be placed in carefully selected cities where a strong soccer market was thought to exist. This was scaled back to ten after potential backers could not be found.&lt;ref name="Wangerin p.272"&gt;Wangerin p.272&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually 22 communities submitted formal bids to host an inaugural MLS franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51837814.html?dids=51837814:51837814&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+19,+1994&amp;author=BRIAN+LANDMAN&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;desc=Tampa+in,+Orlando+out+of+MLS+running+Series:+SOCCER&amp;pqatl=google | work=St. Petersburg Times | title=Tampa in, Orlando out of MLS running Series: SOCCER | first=Brian | last=Landman | date=May 19, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial ten teams created were the [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]], [[D.C. United]], [[New England Revolution]], New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now the [[New York Red Bulls]]), [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]], [[Colorado Rapids]], Dallas Burn (now [[FC Dallas]]), Kansas City Wiz (eventually Wizards; now [[Sporting Kansas City]]), [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] and [[San Jose Clash]] (now the [[San Jose Earthquakes]]). While New York City and Los Angeles were awarded franchises, the next four largest American cities – Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, and Detroit – were all without a team.&lt;ref name="Wangerin p.272"/&gt; Using [[American football]] stadiums, the new league kicked off in April 1996.

=== Expansion: Chicago and Miami (1998) ===
{{Main|Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Miami Fusion}}

In 1998, the league expanded for the first time, rising from ten teams to twelve. The new teams were the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] and [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]]. Miami owner Ken Horowitz paid a $20&amp;nbsp;million expansion fee for the right to join MLS.&lt;ref name="soccertimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|title=MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision|date=December 27, 2001|work=SoccerTimes|first=Robert|last=Wagman|access-date=June 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115539/http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contraction from Florida (2002) ===
{{Main|Miami Fusion|Tampa Bay Mutiny}}

Major League Soccer had reportedly lost an estimated $250&amp;nbsp;million during its first five years.&lt;ref name=profit&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Stanley |title=Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=November 22, 2004 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html|title=For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder|date=November 11, 2005|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Eligon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's poor financial condition forced MLS to stop the bleeding.  During the winter break between the 2000 and 2001 seasons, reports began circulating that MLS was considering trimming the league from 12 teams back to 10 teams.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|title=MLS considering weight-loss program|date=December 28, 2000|work=ESPN Soccernet|first=Jeff|last=Bradley}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the two Florida franchises, the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/us_sport/1750024.stm |work=BBC News| title=Fusion and Mutiny fold | date=January 9, 2002 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams were withdrawn from the league and folded. The league had chosen to fold the Miami Fusion, in part because the Fusion's ownership reportedly lacked financial resources, had been trying to run the Fusion on a bare-minimum budget, and had asked the League to pay some of the club's expenses.&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt; Miami ownership had reportedly experienced $15&amp;nbsp;million in operating losses since Miami joined the league.&lt;ref name="soccertimes" /&gt; The League chose to fold the Tampa Bay Mutiny, in part because the team was operated by the League instead of by an individual owner, meaning that the League had to absorb 100% of the team's operating losses.&lt;ref name="soccertimes" /&gt;
This contraction left the league with 10 teams, the same number as when MLS began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/01/09/news_pf/Sports/MLS_folds_Mutiny.shtml |title=Sports: MLS folds Mutiny |work=St Petersburg Times |date=January 9, 2002 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth phase: 2004–present ==
In 2004, MLS began a significant expansion phase, more than doubling in size from 10 teams in 2003 to 24 teams by 2019.

=== Los Angeles and Salt Lake City (2005) ===
{{Main|Chivas USA|Real Salt Lake}}
[[File:Dave Checketts, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Dave Checketts]], owner of [[Real Salt Lake]], who kicked off in 2005]]
The performance of the [[United States men's national soccer team|US national team]] at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], where they reached the [[Single-elimination tournament|quarter-final]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa020614a.htm |title=Germany and Soccer – Fussball in Deutschland |work=German.about.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a recovery in the league's fortunes, and attendances once again began to rise. MLS began looking to expand once more with a number of cities interested in hosting new teams. The demand for an expansion team grew.

In 2004, MLS awarded a second franchise to the Los Angeles area, [[Chivas USA]]. The team was owned partly by [[C.D.

The league also announced [[Real Salt Lake]] in 2004. The franchise received permission to use the "Real" name from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] as part of a business agreement between the Salt Lake owner [[Dave Checketts]] and the Spanish club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/the-real-story-madrid-to-salt-lake-city/|title=The Real Story: Madrid to Salt Lake City|series=Goal|work=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2007 | accessdate = October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real Salt Lake initially played its home games at [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]] on the [[University of Utah]] campus before moving to [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in the suburb of [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700265433/Real-Salt-Lake-fans-get-a-kick-out-of-Rio-Tinto-Stadium.html?pg=all|title=Real Salt Lake fans get a kick out of Rio Tinto Stadium|first=Michael|last=Black|work=Deseret News|date=October 10, 2008| accessdate = October 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relocation: Houston (2006) ===
{{Main|Houston Dynamo}}

In 2005, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] were put on hiatus because of a failure to secure a [[soccer-specific stadium]]. The players and the coach were moved to an expansion team in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], where they became the [[Houston Dynamo]] playing out of [[Robertson Stadium]].&lt;ref name="mlsnet1"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/san-jose-earthquakes-return-major-league-soccer-2008|title=San Jose Earthquakes to return to Major League Soccer in 2008|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of teams in the league did not change.

{{Main|Toronto FC}}

In November 2005, Major League Soccer announced that it had approved an expansion franchise in Toronto to be owned and operated by [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]], which also owns the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Toronto Raptors]]. The [[Toronto City Council]] had previously approved $9.8&amp;nbsp;million in funding for a $62.8-million stadium, with the rest of the money coming from MLSE, the federal government, and the provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/mls-approves-toronto-expansion-franchise-1.530033|title=MLS approves Toronto expansion franchise|date=November 12, 2005|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team name [[Toronto FC]] and logo were announced in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/mls_toronto/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108215658/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/mls_toronto/index.html|title=The beautiful game in Toronto|date=May 11, 2006|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|archivedate=November 8, 2012|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club played their first season in MLS in 2007, finishing at the bottom of the table. The introduction of MLS into Canada took MLS into a separate country for the first time.

=== San Jose (2008) ===
{{Main|San Jose Earthquakes}}

After a two-year hiatus, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] were reactivated in 2007 and resumed play in MLS in 2008.&lt;ref name="mlsnet1"/&gt;

=== Seattle (2009) ===
{{Main|Seattle Sounders FC}}

[[Seattle]] was awarded a franchise in 2007, and following a write-in vote by supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.soundersfc.com/post/2008/04/07/seattle-sounders-fc-selected-team-name|title=Seattle Sounders FC Selected as Team Name|via=soundersfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team chose the name [[Seattle Sounders FC]], after the [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]] that played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] in the 1970s and '80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=soccer&amp;id=3334786 |title=New Seattle MLS team will be called Seattle Sounders FC  |publisher=ESPN Sports |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city did not have a [[soccer-specific stadium]] or any plans to construct one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2007-11-09-3226911324_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Seattle to get expansion MLS franchise for 2009 | date=November 9, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010 | first=Gregg | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead, it shared Qwest Field (now known as [[CenturyLink Field]]) with the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the [[National Football League]] who, like the Sounders, were owned in part by the late [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/10/sports/NA-SPT-SOC-Seattle-MLS-Franchise.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |work=International Herald Tribune |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was built as a combined football/soccer stadium with an MLS team in mind, including soccer-specific features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000510&amp;slug=4020160|title=Sports – MLS team in Seattle no sure bet – Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philadelphia (2010) ===
{{Main|Philadelphia Union}}

On February 28, 2008, MLS announced that the sixteenth franchise would be awarded to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/mls-awards-philadelphia-2010-expansion-team|title=MLS awards Philadelphia 2010 expansion team|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia was appealing to MLS because Philadelphia was the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. without an MLS franchise, and it had a strong ownership group.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-02-13/news/24989024_1_dan-courtemanche-mls-officials-stadium-deal|title=Soccer deal is within reach, say sources|date=February 13, 2008|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|first=Jeff|last=Gammage}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a strong campaign to bring a team to the city, with intense lobbying by supporters groups such as the [[Sons of Ben (MLS supporters association)|Sons of Ben]].

Philadelphia won the bid over a competing bid from St. Louis that was led by St. Louis investor Jeff Cooper. St. Louis had a stadium deal in [[Collinsville, Illinois]], but lacked sufficient financing.&lt;ref name="inquirer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/17/meet-mls-in-st-louis/|title=Meet M.L.S. in St. Louis|date=November 17, 2007|work=The New York Times|series=Goal|first=Jack|last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver and Portland (2011) ===
{{Main|Vancouver Whitecaps FC|Portland Timbers}}

One of three Canadian cities in the running for 2011 MLS expansion, [[Vancouver]]'s bid was led by local businessman Greg Kerfoot, at that time owner of the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986–2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] in [[USSF Division 2 Professional League|USSF D2 Pro]]. NBA star [[Steve Nash]] was also involved as a minority stakeholder. The city's bid was boosted by the proposed construction of the [[Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium]], with an initial capacity of 20,000 and the potential for further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Vancouver MLS bid hits NYC | url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/soccer/2008/10/08/7012621-sun.html | location=Vancouver | agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|work=[[Toronto Sun]] | date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Garber called the bid presentation by Vancouver "one of the best I've ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=MLS expansion fee won't scare away Whitecaps | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=a0af2cc5-5873-45db-a550-724e0daac136 | author=Ian Walker | work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] | date=October 25, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090632/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/sports/story.html?id=a0af2cc5-5873-45db-a550-724e0daac136 | archivedate=March 4, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 18, 2009, MLS commissioner Don Garber announced that Vancouver had been awarded one of the two 2011 expansion spots. Vancouver continued to field the second-tier Whitecaps until the MLS team made its debut in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2206727|title=Whitecaps, Impact announce plans for new league|date=May 11, 2006|agency=Canwest News Service|first=Scott|last=Brown|author2=Randy Phillips|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLS Whitecaps began the 2011 season at [[Empire Field]], sharing it with the [[BC Lions]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], before both teams moved into the renovated [[BC Place]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=MLS awards Vancouver team for 2011 | url=http://www.whitecapsfc.com/news/2009/03/mls-awards-vancouver-team-2011 | publisher=Major League Soccer | date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2008, [[Merritt Paulson]] announced that he would apply for an MLS franchise for Portland as an MLS continuation of the [[Portland Timbers (2001–10)|Portland Timbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/sportsupdates/2008/07/portland_paulson_to_submit_app.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Portland, Paulson to submit application for MLS expansion franchise | date=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulson further outlined his plan by launching a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlstoportland.com |title=mlstoportland.com |work=mlstoportland.com |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLS Timbers would play in a renovated PGE Park, which was renamed to Jeld-Wen Field by the time the team made its MLS debut in 2011 and is now known as [[Providence Park]], sharing with the [[Portland State Vikings football|Portland State University football]] team.
On March 20, 2009, commissioner Don Garber confirmed in a news conference that Portland would receive the 18th franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/mls-awards-18th-franchise-portland|title=MLS awards 18th franchise to Portland|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Montreal (2012) ===
{{main|Montreal Impact}}

The city of [[Montreal]] had been in consideration by [[Major League Soccer]] for a club since the league's founding and planning stages in 1993. In the fall of 2008, the [[Joey Saputo]] group was on a short list for the next round of expansion. On May 7, 2010, Commissioner [[Don Garber]] announced that Saputo and the [[Montreal Impact|Impact]] group would join the league as its 19th club for the [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012 MLS season]] with [[Saputo Stadium|Stade Saputo]] being renovated to increase the seating capacity to around 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://montrealgazette.com/Long+wait+over+Impact+joins/3001135/story.html |title= Long wait over as Impact joins MLS |work= The Gazette|location=Montreal|date= May 7, 2010 |accessdate= February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissolution of Chivas USA (2014) ===
{{See also|Chivas USA}}

Chivas USA was dissolved following the end of the [[2014 Chivas USA season|2014 regular season]], after the league bought the franchise and took over the operations from [[Jorge Vergara]] and [[Angélica Fuentes]] in February that year, leaving the league with 20 teams for the 2015 season. The club had suffered poor performance on the field, low attendance and a series of discrimination lawsuits against the ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/chivas-usa/story/2112968/mls-shuts-down-chivas-usanew-clubownership-to-return-in-2017|title=MLS shuts down Chivas USA; new club, ownership to return in 2017|first=Jeff|last=Carlisle|publisher=ESPN FC|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner Garber cited the "brand that was targeted specifically to the Hispanic market" and the belief that "the club could coexist with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy|Galaxy]] and share the [[StubHub Center]]" as mistakes.&lt;ref name="Chivas Ives"&gt;{{cite news | title = With Chivas USA a memory, MLS commish looks ahead to new LA team | work = Soccer By Ives  | url = http://www.soccerbyives.net/2014/10/discusses-failures-torres.html | accessdate = October 28, 2014 | date = October 28, 2014 | first = Ryan | last = Tolmich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2016, Don Garber visited with [[Cincinnati]]'s mayor John Cranley, officials from [[FC Cincinnati (2016–18)|FC Cincinnati]] of the USL, and civic and business leaders of the city to talk about a possible expansion. FC Cincinnati, in its first season in the USL in 2016, broke the USL's single-season attendance record, averaging 17,296 fans per game at [[Nippert Stadium]]. They also set the league's single-game playoff record for attendance with 30,187 spectators on October 2.

===Miami (2020)===

Garber confirmed in a July 5, 2013, interview that Miami, Atlanta, Orlando, and Texas were all candidates for MLS expansion.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg TV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/summertime-is-soccer-time-in-america-0DkiYhYNTCevS6wSInlweQ.html|title=Summertime Is Soccer Time in America|date=July 5, 2013|publisher=Bloomberg TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2014, the league announced that it would award a franchise in Miami to an investment group led by former player [[David Beckham]], his business partner [[Simon Fuller]], and Miami-based businessman [[Marcelo Claure]], assuming that stadium financing and location could be agreed upon.&lt;ref name="Miami Beckham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/02/05/3914127/soccer-star-david-beckham-to-bring.html|title=Soccer star David Beckham to bring MLS team to Miami|work=The Miami Herald|first=Patricia|last=Mazzei|date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ownership group's two stadium sites were rejected by city and county governments by July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | title = David Beckham's Miami MLS plans on hold until stadium secured | work = Sports Illustrated | date=July 29, 2014 | url = https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2014/07/29/mls-miami-downtown-stadium-david-beckham | accessdate = August 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2014 Q&amp;A session, deputy commissioner Mark Abbott said Miami would be the 23rd team as long as a downtown stadium deal could be reached.&lt;ref name="SI.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bird|first1=Liviu|title=MLS All-Star Notes: Mark Abbott on expansion, Blatter; Training contrast|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/08/05/mls-all-star-game-bayern-munich-mark-abbott-expansion-tv-blatter|accessdate=August 6, 2014|work=Planet Futbol|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner Garber said he hoped to see Miami join the league with Atlanta in 2017, but repeated that the team would not play without political support for a downtown stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political will key to Beckham's MLS Miami plan: Garber|url=http://wtaq.com/news/articles/2014/oct/23/political-will-key-to-beckhams-mls-miami-plan-garber/|publisher=WTAQ|first=Simon|last=Evans|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next development in the Beckham plan came on July 17, 2015, when Miami mayor [[Tomás Pedro Regalado|Tomás Regalado]] announced a tentative deal with the ownership group, now known as Beckham United, for a new privately financed stadium in [[Little Havana]] next to [[Marlins Park]], at the former site of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/07/17/beckham-united-miami-mayor-agree-new-mls-stadium-plan |title=Beckham United &amp; Miami mayor agree on new MLS stadium plan |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=July 17, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plans for the Orange Bowl site fell through later that year after Beckham United was unable to secure deals with private owners of adjacent land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2015/11/30/10172/beckham-reportedly-throws-in-towel-on-soccer-stadium-alongside-marlins-park/|title=Beckham reportedly throws in towel on soccer stadium alongside Marlins Park|date=November 30, 2015|first=Neil|last=DeMause|work=Field of Schemes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December of that year, Beckham United announced that a new stadium site, mostly private land but also containing a tract owned by [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], had been selected in Miami's [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article47939140.html |title=Beckham announces Overtown site for soccer stadium |first1=Douglas|last1= Hanks |first2=David |last2=Smiley |date=December 4, 2015|newspaper=The Miami Herald|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLS governing board soon approved the location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/morning-edition/2015/12/mls-approves-miami-beckham-united-expansion.html|title=Major League Soccer approves David Beckham's expansion team in Miami, Overtown location – South Florida Business Journal|author=Brian Bandell|date=December 7, 2015|work=South Florida Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Beckham group completed the purchase of the privately owned tracts in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article68064887.html |title=David Beckham group buys private land needed for Miami soccer stadium |first1=Douglas |last1=Hanks |first2=David |last2=Smiley |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations with county officials to assemble the final section of the stadium site are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article76065727.html |title=David Beckham stadium talks with Miami-Dade hit a snag |work=The Miami Herald|author=Douglas Hanks |date= May 6, 2016 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nashville (2020)===
{{Main|Nashville SC (MLS)}}
In August 2016, a group of Nashville business leaders from several of the city's largest corporations formed the Nashville MLS Organizing Committee and began efforts to secure funding for an MLS stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/12/19/tennessee-legislature-proposes-bill-help-fund-nashville-mls-stadium"Tennessee legislature proposes bill to help fund Nashville MLS stadium"], MLS Soccer, December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The group, led by Bill Hagerty, pursued an MLS team immediately rather than work up the soccer pyramid.

Both groups support each other in their common vision to grow the sport in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/08/09/nashville-business-leaders-form-group-bring-mls-music-city"Nashville business leaders form group to bring MLS to the Music City"], MLS Soccer, August 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the group unveiled their plans for $275&amp;nbsp;million stadium and redevelopment project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/article/20980225/soccer-stadium-backers-detail-redevelopment-plans |title=Soccer stadium backers detail redevelopment plans |work=[[Nashville Post]] |date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/10/24/nashville-mls-stadium-supporters-pack-hearing-fairgrounds-proposal/790117001/ |title=Nashville soccer fans come out in force for $275M MLS stadium proposal |work=[[The Tennessean]] |date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved by the city in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/story/3263044/nashville-mls-expansion-bid-gets-boost-from-initial-$275m-stadium-approval |title=Nashville MLS expansion bid gets boost from $275m stadium approval |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nashville was the first confirmed team approved by the MLS during this phase of expansion on December 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/major-league-soccer/story/3318519/mls-confirms-nashville-will-be-home-to-its-latest-expansion-franchise |title=MLS confirms Nashville will be home to its latest expansion franchise |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austin (2021)===

On December 7, 2018, Garber announced in his annual State of the League news conference that "within the next few years MLS will become the first major sports league to have a team in the culturally dynamic city of Austin" with more details to come in the months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statesman.com/sports/20181207/commissioner-don-garber-more-details-on-mls-in-austin-soon |title=Commissioner Don Garber: More details on MLS in Austin soon |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=December 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Louis (2022)===
{{Main|St. Louis MLS team}}
Jeff Cooper attempted in 2008 and 2009 to bring an MLS expansion team to [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis]], only to have both bids turned down in favor of other cities. Despite approved stadium plans to build the $600&amp;nbsp;million [[Collinsville Soccer Complex]], MLS was not impressed with the bid's financial backing and suggested Cooper expand his group of investors.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Cooper instead launched a second division men's club and a [[Women's Professional Soccer]] franchise. [[AC St. Louis]] played only one season in [[USSF Division 2 Professional League|Division 2]] averaging 2,750 fans during the 2010 season before folding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidemnsoccer.com/2011/01/17/ac-st-louis-closes-its-doors-for-good/|title=AC St. Louis Closes its Doors for Good|last=Quarstad|first=Brian|date=January 17, 2011|work=IMS Soccer News}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2013}} and the [[Saint Louis Athletica]] folded midway through its second season in 2010.

[[St. Louis]] announced in late 2014 that it was planning [[National Car Rental Field|a new stadium]] to host both American football and soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/sports/football/wary-of-losing-rams-st-louis-is-set-to-huddle-on-stadium.html|title=Saint Louis is set to huddle on stadium|date=November 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garber stated in January 2015 that: "St. Louis has got a lot of activity going on with a stadium that they’re trying to get done for the [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]]". There's a big soccer community out there and we'd love to see a soccer stadium downtown like they're thinking about a football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mlsmultiplex.com/2015/01/16/don-garber-says-mls-heading-st-louis/|title=Don Garber Says MLS Could Be Heading To St. Louis|date=January 16, 2015|work=MLS Multiplex|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Garber visited St. Louis to talk about a possible new multi-purpose stadium that would be capable of holding soccer games. Garber cautioned that any possible expansion to St. Louis would occur after 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/05/19/mls-commissioner-don-garber-meets-st-louis-officials-discuss-future-expansion "MLS Commissioner Don Garber meets with St. Louis officials to discuss future expansion"], MLSsoccer.com, Dan Itel, May 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2016, St. Louis lawmaker, Keith English proposed a bill that would put a tax of not more than one-tenth of one percent on the ballot in St. Louis and [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], it also calls for the RSA to oversee the soccer stadium.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The proposed tax would only go into effect if MLS awards a team to St. Louis by December 20, 2020.  On February 17, 2016, the MLS2STL group was formed to bring an MLS team to the [[St. Louis area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sj-r.com/news/20160217/st-louis-group-formed-to-attract-mls-expansion-franchise|title=St. Louis group formed to attract MLS expansion franchise|date=February 17, 2016|newspaper=[[The State Journal-Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2017, a funding plan for a [[St. Louis MLS stadium|soccer-specific stadium]] adjacent to Union Station in downtown St. Louis was approved by the city's Aldermanic Ways and Means Committee.  The proposed bill still needed to be approved by the entire Board of Aldermen before it was brought to a public vote on the April 4, 2017, general municipal ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-louis-bid-for-soccer-team-back-in-play-after/article_e86ec674-e480-5b4e-baa7-f3119992bd19.html|title=New life emerges for St. Louis soccer stadium|last=Faulk|first=Mike|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public vote failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox2now.com/2017/04/05/mls-stadium-measure-fails-in-st-louis/|title=MLS stadium measure fails in St. Louis|date=April 5, 2017|work=FOX2now.com|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2018, the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' reported that officials with the Missouri Department of Economic Development met with Major League Soccer representatives on a stadium proposal and St. Louis mayor Lyda Krewson confirmed there is a group trying to bring a team to St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/soccer-stadium-talks-back-on-again-in-st-louis/article_d66a9e8e-1439-57be-be85-b697715d6b79.html|title=Soccer stadium talks back on in St. Louis|last=Feldt|first=Brian|work=stltoday.com|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following speculation of a new ownership group and stadium proposal, on October 9, 2018, the bid was effectively re-launched, with Carolyn Kindle Betz and other members of the [[Jack C.

They met with league officials during the week of the [[2014 MLS All-Star Game]], and deputy commissioner Mark Abbott said league executives would visit the city and tour possible stadium locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lillis|first1=Ryan|title=Major League Soccer to tour possible stadium sites in Sacramento|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/08/05/6607197/major-league-soccer-to-tour-possible.html|accessdate=August 6, 2014|work=Sacramento Bee|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings owner Ranadive announced in January 2015 that he had joined the Republic ownership group, in a move seen as bolstering the city's chances of landing an MLS berth.&lt;ref name="sbisoccer.com"&gt;[http://www.sbisoccer.com/2015/01/sacramento-republic-investor.html "SACRAMENTO KINGS JOIN REPUBLIC AS INVESTOR IN MLS PUSH"], SBI Soccer, January 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2015, the York family, owners of the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]], agreed to invest in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/sports/mls/article8604596.html "49ers’ owners to invest in Sacramento Republic FC"], ''Sacramento Bee'', January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacramento's bid is also strengthened by its fan support. Upon their debut in 2014, the Republic set a USL single-game attendance record by selling out their first-ever home game at 20,000-seat [[Charles C. Hughes Stadium|Hughes Stadium]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2014/04/26/6357273/republic-fc-loses-home-opener.html "Republic FC loses home opener before sellout crowd at Hughes Stadium"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210131/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/04/26/6357273/republic-fc-loses-home-opener.html |date=April 27, 2014 }}, Sacramento Bee, April 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; since moving to the smaller, soccer-specific stadium now known as [[Papa Murphy's Park]] midway through 2014, the team has continued to play in front of capacity crowds. As of January 2015, the club had nearly 10,000 ticket deposits as part of its "Built for MLS" campaign.&lt;ref name="sbisoccer.com"/&gt;

In March 2015, Sacramento mayor [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] announced a joint initiative of the city and the club dubbed "Operation Turnkey", which would have stadium construction ready to begin should one of the other expansion candidates without a firm stadium plan fail to come up with one or the league decided to expand beyond 24 teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = MLS Expansion: Sacramento eyes team despite Miami, Minnesota | work = Sports Illustrated | url = https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/03/17/sacramento-mls-expansion-minnesota-miami-kevin-johnson-beckham# | accessdate = March 22, 2015 | date = March 15, 2015 | first = Brian | last = Straus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, MLS commissioner Don Garber announced that the league would expand to 28 teams and said "I hope, and fully expect, Sacramento to be one (of the 28)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2016/04/14/commissioner-we-hopeexpect-sacramento-join-mls.html "Commissioner: 'We hope and expect' Sacramento will join MLS"], April 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2017, after the official bid package was submitted without the Republic name or brand, Sacramento mayor [[Darrell Steinberg]] announced an agreement in principle for the Republic to be acquired by Sac Soccer &amp; Entertainment Holdings, the company behind the submitted bid.&lt;ref name="acquire17"/&gt; Should the city's bid for an MLS expansion team succeed, it will indeed enter the league as Sacramento Republic FC.&lt;ref name="acquire17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/02/05/sacramento-mls-bid-group-enters-agreement-acquire-sacramento-republic-fc|title=Sacramento MLS bid group enters agreement to acquire Sacramento Republic FC|publisher=MLSSoccer|date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, the group began preparations for building a 19,621-seat stadium in downtown Sacramento for the bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/city-beat/article163854248.html |title=Big step in Sacramento's Major League Soccer bid |work=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the group had 10,000 commitments for season tickets for the proposed MLS team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/sports/mls/article180795416.html |title=10,000 Sacramento fans commit to buy MLS season tickets, Republic FC reports |work=The Sacramento Bee |date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2019, billionaire [[Ron Burkle]] was announced as the Republic's new lead investor to satisfy MLS requirements. Burkle has held a controlling stake in the NHL's [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] since 1999, and previously made an attempt to buy the Sacramento Kings. Burkle also purchased the Republic's proposed stadium site at the [[Sacramento Railyards]], along with an additional 14 acres to be developed into an entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/major-league-soccer/story/3756895/sacramento-republics-mls-hopes-get-boost-as-ron-burkle-agrees-to-take-over-team |title=Sacramento Republic's MLS hopes get boost as Ron Burkle agrees to take over team |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=January 22, 2019 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2019, the Republic was officially announced as the 29th team in Major League Soccer, joining the league in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/10/21/major-league-soccer-awards-expansion-team-sacramento|title=Major League Soccer awards expansion team to Sacramento|date=October 21, 2019|publisher=Major League Soccer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current expansion candidates ==
Commissioner Don Garber stated in May 2018 that "Detroit, Sacramento, San Diego are still in active discussions with us"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wzzm13.com/article/sports/soccer/detroits-2020-mls-bid-hindered-by-choosing-ford-field/69-559824127|title=Detroit's 2020 MLS bid hindered by choosing Ford Field|work=wzzm13.com|publisher=WZZM-TV|date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2018 "We continue to believe that with the right ownership group, stadium plan and support from the corporate community, St. Louis could be a successful Major League Soccer market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/09/27/st-louis-mayor-prospective-owners-pursuing-mls-team|title=St. Louis mayor: Prospective owners pursuing MLS team|date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2019, the league announced it would expand to 30 teams. Ownership groups from Sacramento and St. Louis were given exclusive rights to negotiate for spots 28 and 29 at an expansion fee of $200&amp;nbsp;million each, while the league's Board of Governors deferred a decision on a fee and timetable for the 30th team. St. Louis was announced as the 28th team in August 2019, while Sacramento was announced as the 29th team on October 21 of that year.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Las Vegas ===
The ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' reported on May 14, 2014, that a potential ownership group held talks about an expansion team in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/05/14/report-las-vegas-talks-mls-bring-expansion-club-city-build-soccer-specific-s |title=Report: Las Vegas in talks with MLS to bring expansion club to city, build soccer-specific stadium |work=MLSsoccer.com |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investor group, consisting of Findlay Sports and Entertainment and real estate developers, [[Cordish Company]], acquired a 61-acre site at [[Symphony Park]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] from the city and released a plan to build a 24,000-seat stadium there.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/5/14/5718422/las-vegas-mls-expansion |title=Las Vegas launches MLS expansion bid |work=SBNation.com |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas Mayor, [[Carolyn Goodman (politician)|Carolyn Goodman]], and the Findlay group expressed preference for a downtown stadium.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snel|first1=Alan|title=City of Las Vegas turns suitor's attention toward Major League Soccer|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/city-las-vegas-turns-suitor-s-attention-toward-major-league-soccer|accessdate=June 3, 2014|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; League deputy commissioner Mark Abbott visited the city in July 2014 to meet with Mayor Goodman and to tour the downtown area.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firchau|first1=Nick|title=Thinking long-term, MLS in "preliminary discussions" over expansion franchise in Las Vegas|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/07/21/thinking-long-term-mls-preliminary-discussions-over-expansion-franchise-las-|accessdate=August 6, 2014|work=MLSsoccer.com|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/lights-fc-soccer/5-things-to-know-as-las-vegas-pursues-mls-expansion-team-1689254/|title=5 things to know as Las Vegas pursues MLS expansion team|date=June 17, 2019|accessdate=June 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2014, the Las Vegas City Council approved public funding of $56.5&amp;nbsp;million for the proposed soccer stadium in Symphony Park, contingent on MLS granting an expansion franchise to Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/dec/17/city-council-set-vote-las-vegas-soccer-stadium/|title=City Council approves funding for Las Vegas soccer stadium|first=Conor|last=Shine|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garber notified Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman on February 12, 2015 that MLS no longer considered Las Vegas as an expansion market until after 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/02/12/las-vegas-no-longer-consideration-mls-expansion-until-after-2018/|title=Las Vegas no longer in consideration for MLS expansion until after 2018|work=MLSsoccer.com|date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential for a Las Vegas team was revived in January 2017 by the city council approaching a sports investment bank but an official bid was not reported by MLS.&lt;ref name="12Bids"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/12-groups-submit-mls-expansion-applications/n-5232189 |title=12 Groups Submit MLS Expansion Applications |publisher=OurSports Central |date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2017, Las Vegas was awarded a [[Las Vegas Lights FC|USL expansion franchise]] to begin play at [[Cashman Field]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/822459?referrer_id=2349190|title=Las Vegas Joins the USL in 2018 Season|date=August 11, 2017|publisher=United Soccer League (USL)|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charlotte ===
In 2017 [[Speedway Motorsports]] CEO [[Marcus G. Smith|Marcus Smith]] led an effort for MLS expansion to Charlotte that initially included a 20,000 to 30,000 seat stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2017/01/9/charlotte-leaders-negotiating-deal-to-bid-for-major-league-soccer-team-at-memorial-stadium.html|title=Charlotte Leaders Negotiating Deal to Bid for Major League Soccer Team at Memorial Stadium|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smiths' bid was not affiliated with the USL's [[Charlotte Independence]]. In October 2017, however, the Charlotte city council confirmed that they would be unable to come up with the financing needed for the MLS deadline for expansion proposals, at which point the bid was effectively dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article180429991.html |title=Charlotte's Major League Soccer dreams are dead for now.

In March 2019 [[Carolina Panthers]] owner [[David Tepper]] and officials began discussions with MLS to start another bid for a Charlotte based MLS team. After MLS announced that they would be expanding to 30 teams, the Panthers officially reactivated the bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article229456349.html |title=Major League Soccer expands again, opening door for Charlotte and David Tepper |work=The Charlotte Observer |date=April 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phoenix ===
In 2017, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] entered the race for an expansion team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/mls-expansion-phoenix-cities-list-012617 |title=Phoenix set to join the race for an MLS expansion team |date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid for expansion is led by the ownership group of [[Phoenix Rising FC]] of the [[United Soccer League]] including [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Phoenix Rising FC player [[Didier Drogba]].&lt;ref name="12Bids"/&gt; Phoenix Rising recently signed an agreement with [[Goldman Sachs]] to help the funding of a new 20,000 person [[Phoenix MLS stadium|stadium]] on land purchased from the [[Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community|Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]] if selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.phxrisingfc.com/news_article/show/788390?referrer_id=2717359|title=Phoenix Rising Football Club retains Goldman Sachs as Structuring Agent for MLS Soccer Stadium|last=Communications|first=Phoenix Rising FC|date=May 3, 2017|work=Phoenix Rising FC {{!}} Arizona's Highest Level Professional Soccer Team|access-date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indianapolis ===
In January 2017, Indianapolis launched an official bid to upgrade their NASL franchise, the [[Indy Eleven]], to an MLS expansion member, but their bid was not chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2017/01/30/indy-eleven-apply-mls-expansion/97271092/ |title=Indy Eleven to apply for MLS expansion |date=January 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 10, 2019 Indy Eleven, now an USL team led by developer and owner Ersal Ozdemir of Keystone Group re-launched the talks for the stadium, now anchoring a planned neighborhood named "Eleven Park". This planned neighborhood included 150,000 square feet of office space, 100,000 square feet of retail, 600 apartment units, a 200-room boutique hotel and was anchored by a 20,000-seat multi-purpose soccer stadium.

This section includes cities with bids that have either failed or stalled, or are otherwise not explicitly included in the MLS expansion roadmap, the latest of which was announced in December 2013.&lt;ref name="roadmap 2013"/&gt;

=== Cleveland (2004–06) ===
MLS announced in 2004 that Cleveland would be getting an expansion franchise for the 2005 season, as area businessman [[Bert Wolstein]] had signed a letter of intent to launch an MLS club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/mls/2004/may16.htm|title=Several cities vie for expansion teams as complications delay decision|date= May 16, 2004|work=Soccer Times|first=Robert|last=Wagman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wolstein ran into delays in trying to obtain public financing for a stadium, and died in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/mls/2004/may17|title=Bert Wolstein, a soccer pioneer, dies at 77|date= May 17, 2004|work=Soccer Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 the Wolstein Sports and Entertainment Group proposed the construction of a soccer-specific stadium for an MLS club in the Cleveland suburb of [[Macedonia, Ohio|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2010/09/macedonia_planning_for_soccer.html|title=Macedonia planning for soccer|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 21, 2007|first=Laura|last=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] voters rejected a tax to raise $104&amp;nbsp;million of the $165&amp;nbsp;million needed, environmental groups raised concerns about area wetlands, and the area was hit by the [[Great Recession]] of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/09/post_353.html|title=Star Calendar print shop; a soccer stadium in Macedonia: Whatever happened to …?|date=September 20, 2010|work=The Plain Dealer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Commissioner Garber said there had not been any developments regarding MLS expansion in Cleveland since talks were held "many years ago."&lt;ref name="March 2014"/&gt;

Detroit was considered by MLS to be one of the frontrunners for a 2020 bid, but MLS soured on Detroit when the ownership group decided not to build a soccer-specific stadium and to use Ford Field instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180529/news/662121/detroit-bid-in-limbo-after-mls-awards-latest-expansion-club-to "Detroit bid in limbo after MLS awards latest expansion club to Cincinnati"], Crain's Detroit Business, May 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miami (2008–09) ===
A [[Miami]] expansion team led by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Marcelo Claure]], a Bolivian businessman based in the city, announced an expansion bid in October 2008, with plans to begin play in [[2011 Major League Soccer season|2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnfc.com/print?id=581958&amp;type=story|title=Barcelona to bid for Miami MLS franchise|date=October 15, 2008|work=ESPNsoccernet|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in March 2009, the league and Barcelona announced that Miami was no longer a candidate due to local market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2009/03/03/1137156/miami-barcelona-mls-campaign-is-dead|title=Miami Barcelona MLS Campaign Is Dead|work=Goal.com|date=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, MLS expressed concerns about Miami's lack of fan interest in an MLS franchise, the fact that [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]] team [[Miami FC (2006)|Miami FC]] was not doing well, and the plan to use [[FIU Stadium]] relegating the team to a secondary tenant in a [[college football]] stadium with an artificial surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-03-04/sports/0903030502_1_fc-barcelona-mls-garber|title=Miami bid is yanked|date= March 4, 2009|work=Sun-Sentinel|first=Jeff|last=Rusnak}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Garber said that Miami would be an expansion target in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-03-08/sports/0903070054_1_mls-cup-garber-mls-team|title=MLS, Miami have miles to go before new club could thrive|date= March 8, 2009|work=Sun-Sentinel|first=Jeff|last=Rusnak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claure later joined [[David Beckham]]'s group of investors for the [[Inter Miami CF|Miami expansion bid]] that was accepted by the league in 2014.

=== San Antonio (2011–17) ===
A previous San Antonio expansion bid ended in 2005, when negotiations between the league and then-mayor [[Edward D. Garza|Ed Garza]] ended. Incoming mayor [[Phil Hardberger]] criticized the proposed deal, while Garber claimed that the criticisms were politically motivated and hurt efforts to sell season tickets and recruit local investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2005-06-09-san-antonio_x.htm |title=Major League Soccer ends talks with San Antonio |agency=Associated Press |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, San Antonio announced its bid to be MLS's 20th team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2011-12-14/sacramento-san-antonio-join-fight-for-mls-expansion-team |title=San Antonio joins fight for MLS expansion team |work=Sporting News |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's [[North American Soccer League]] franchise, the [[San Antonio Scorpions]], launched in 2012 and led the league in attendance in 2012 and 2013 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2012/09/28/Research-and-Ratings/NASL-attendance.aspx|title=NASL Attendance Up 1.1%; San Antonio Scorpions Lead League in Debut Season|date= September 28, 2012|work=Sports Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanantonioscorpions.com/stadium/toyota-field |title=San Antonio Scorpions Toyota Field |publisher=San Antonio Scorpions |date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107213036/http://sanantonioscorpions.com/stadium/toyota-field |archive-date=November 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Commissioner Garber's December 2013 State of the League address, San Antonio was one of five cities listed on a presentation map of potential expansion locations.&lt;ref name="roadmap 2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2013/12/3/5171460/mls-five-candidiate-cities-expansion |title=MLS names five candidiate cities for expansion|first=Jeremiah|last=Oshan |work=SBNation.com |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2014, Garber said that expansion in the immediate future was "premature" for both San Antonio and Texas, though it was "something that is likely to happen".&lt;ref name="March 2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccer.si.com/2014/03/04/location-by-location-mls-commissioner-don-garbers-response-to-expansion-questions/|title=Location by location, MLS commissioner Don Garber's response to expansion questions|work=Planet Fútbol|first=Avi|last=Creditor|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Garber stated that the league was continuing to evaluate and receive updates on developments in San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/article/MLS-officials-provide-update-on-city-s-5940924.php "MLS officials provide update on city’s development for expansion"], San Antonio Express-News, December 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Potential developments include the emergence of an outside investment group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/scorpions/article/Investors-detail-plan-to-buy-Scorpions-with-MLS-5868769.php "Investors detail plan to buy Scorpions, with MLS goal"], San Antonio Express-News, November 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the expansion plan of the current North American Soccer League stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/09/02/san-antonio-scorpions-release-stadium-expansion-plan-additional-opportunitie "San Antonio Scorpions release stadium expansion plan with 'additional opportunities' like MLS entry in mind"], MLSsoccer.com, September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 2014, Garber revealed that San Antonio was "not as far along" as the three other cities under consideration at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woai.com/articles/woai-local-news-sponsored-by-five-119078/scorpions-owner-san-antonio-made-the-13050933/ "Scorpions Owner: San Antonio 'Made the Cut' for Big League Consideration"], WOAI, December 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But the league continues to monitor progress and efforts toward expansion in San Antonio.&lt;ref name="Louis 2015"&gt;[http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/16/mls-expansion-st-louis-san-antonio-join-race-with-minneapolis-sacramento-las-vegas/ "MLS expansion: St. Louis, San Antonio join race with Minneapolis, Sacramento, Las Vegas"], ProSoccerTalk, January 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2015, the city of San Antonio and [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]] announced plans to purchase Toyota Field for $18&amp;nbsp;million with the intentions of acquiring an MLS franchise. Additionally, [[Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment]], owners of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[San Antonio Spurs]], would hold a 20-year lease to operate the stadium; if SS&amp;E fails to secure an MLS franchise for the stadium within 10 years, the group would owe the city and county a $5&amp;nbsp;million penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=W. Scott|title=Spurs, city and county strike a deal for Toyota Field; MLS team part of the long-term plan|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2015/11/04/spurs-city-and-county-strike-a-deal-for-toyota.html?ana=twt|work=San Antonio Business Journal|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2015, the USL announced that Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment would operate the league's 31st team, [[San Antonio FC]]. The establishment of the club, along with the concurrent purchase of Toyota Field by the city of San Antonio and Bexar County, is part of a plan by local officials to obtain an expansion franchise in Major League Soccer. As a result, the Scorpions franchise was shut down.

On October 16, 2017, [[Columbus Crew]] owner Anthony Precourt announced his intentions of moving his club to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 2019 if a new stadium in downtown Columbus is not built. As downtown Austin is approximately {{convert|75|mi|km|-1}} north of downtown San Antonio, the proposed relocation would be in direct conflict with expansion efforts in San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stacy|first1=Mitch|title=MLS team may move to Austin, could ruin SA's chances of landing team|url=https://www.ksat.com/sports/mls-team-may-move-to-austin-could-ruin-sas-chances-of-landing-team|publisher=KSAT-TV|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jimmy Haslam]], owner of the NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], and Pete Edwards, Jr. acquired the Crew in order to keep the club in Columbus and Precourt was granted rights to an expansion franchise in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleveland Browns owners emerge as potential buyers of Columbus Crew SC|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/10/12/cleveland-browns-owners-emerge-potential-buyers-columbus-crew-sc|website=MLSSoccer.com|publisher=MLS Digital|date=October 12, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Diego (2016–18) ===
Commissioner Garber mentioned San Diego as an expansion candidate in February 2014,&lt;ref name="mlssoccer.com"/&gt; and again in April 2016.&lt;ref name="Commissioner Garber 2016"/&gt; The ownership group includes MLB [[San Diego Padres]] owner Peter Seidler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/story/2901235/san-diego-padres-owner-among-those-interested-in-mls-franchise "San Diego Padres owner among those interested in MLS franchise"], ESPN FC, June 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; An MLS team in San Diego would be located close to two MLS teams in Los Angeles, as well as the Liga MX side Xolos of Tijuana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2859611/talking-points-which-cities-will-major-league-soccer-expand-to-next "Talking Points: Which cities will Major League Soccer expand to next?"], ESPN FC, April 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The NFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] 2017 relocation to Los Angeles has accelerated the chances for an MLS expansion team in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/01/12/chargers-san-diego-la-relocation-galaxy-stub-hub-center-mls-expansion|title=How does the Chargers move to LA impact MLS?|first=Avi|last=Creditor|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/14/mls-commissioner-don-garber-sees-expansion-opportunity-san-diego|title=MLS Commissioner Don Garber sees expansion opportunity in San Diego|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/story/3038118/mls-commissioner-don-garber-hopeful-over-st-louis-san-diego-and-miami-expansion|title=MLS chief Don Garber still hopeful on St. Louis, San Diego, Miami expansion|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2017, a new plan for the Mission Valley site of the facility then known as [[Qualcomm Stadium]] was unveiled by a La Jolla investment group that's trying to lure a Major League Soccer team to San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/34545817/san-diego-investment-group-unveils-new-qualcomm-stadium-proposal|title=San Diego investment group unveils new Qualcomm stadium proposal|publisher=CBS|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The former [[LA Galaxy]] striker [[Landon Donovan]] joined the San Diego ownership group on March 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landon Donovan joins ownership group trying to bring MLS expansion team to San Diego. {{!}} Fox Sports|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/landon-donovan-owner-san-diego-mls-expansion-030317|publisher=Fox Sports|date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garber reported in May 2018 that MLS remained in active discussions with San Diego.

On June 20, 2019, [[Landon Donovan]] was awarded a [[USL San Diego|USL expansion franchise]] in [[San Diego]] to begin play at [[Torero Stadium]] in 2020 or 2021.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/06/19/usl-san-diego-landon-donovan-warren-smith|title=Landon Donovan, Warren Smith bring USL to San Diego|website=SI.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tampa Bay (2016–17) ===

In December 2016, MLS confirmed that Tampa / St. Petersburg was one of its ten potential expansion cities. [[Bill Edwards (businessman)|Bill Edwards]], the majority owner of the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]] started a campaign to join the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/major-league-soccer-announces-tampa-bay-rowdies-as-potential-expansion-team/n-5222501 |title=Major League Soccer Announces Tampa Bay Rowdies as Potential Expansion Team |publisher=OurSports Central |date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, 2017, a special election referendum was held in St. Petersburg to vote on the city negotiating a 25-year land lease for the Tampa Bay Rowdies current waterfront Al Lang Stadium and increasing capacity to 18,000 pending MLS expansion acceptance. The vote was 87% in favor of Al Lang Stadium redesign/expansion, and 13% against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/tampa-bay-rowdies-major-league-soccer-hopes-rest-with-st-petersburg-voters/2322337|title=St. Petersburg voters overwhelmingly bless Tampa Bay Rowdies' bid to join Major League Soccer|website=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other efforts ===
[[Rochester, New York]], had been mentioned as an expansion candidate due to the success of the [[Rochester Rhinos]]. The Rhinos won the [[US Open Cup]] in 1999 – the only non-MLS team to win the Cup since MLS began play three years earlier – and the Rhinos averaged over 10,000 fans from 1999 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccernewsday.com/usa/a/170/the-lost-soccer-city-of-rochester The Lost Soccer City of Rochester] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310080001/http://soccernewsday.com/usa/a/170/the-lost-soccer-city-of-rochester |date=March 10, 2016 }}, Soccer Newsday, June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Don Garber stated: "At some point we want to find a way we can have an MLS team in Rochester."&lt;ref name="democratandchronicle1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20110612/SPORTS05/106120356/Rochester-Rhinos-no-longer-MLS-radar|title=High School Sports – Democrat and Chronicle – democratandchronicle.com|work=Democrat and Chronicle|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Rhinos saw a downturn in attendance and finances, and the city is no longer under consideration by MLS.&lt;ref name="democratandchronicle1"/&gt;

Throughout late 2008 and early 2009, [[Ottawa]] was a longshot candidate for one of two slots for MLS expansion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerbyives.net/2008/10/mls-expansion-c.html "SEVEN MLS EXPANSION CANDIDATES REVEALED"], Soccer By Ives, October 15, 2008.

Retrieved March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2011, Ottawa was awarded a NASL expansion franchise which began play as [[Ottawa Fury FC]] at [[TD Place Stadium]] in 2014; Fury FC moved to USL after the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/oseg-backs-winner-with-ottawa-fury-fc-move-to-usl-1.3824164 |title=OSEG backs winner with Fury FC move to USL |first=Mario |last=Cariucci |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=October 29, 2016 |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS announced in May 2010 the league's desire for a second franchise in New York. The [[New York Cosmos (1971–85)|New York Cosmos]] expressed interest in an MLS expansion franchise, but negotiations between MLS and the Cosmos broke down,&lt;ref name="cosmos_return"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/sports/soccer/02cosmos.html |title=Cosmos Begin Anew, With Eye Toward M.L.S|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2013 | first=Jack | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/sports/soccer/reborn-cosmos-return-to-the-field.html?pagewanted=all|title= Reborn Cosmos Return to the Field|date=August 2, 2013|first=Jack|last=Bell|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Cosmos (2010)|new Cosmos]] began playing in the [[North American Soccer League]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=joinnasl2013&gt;{{cite web|first=Seamus|last=O'Brien|url=http://nycosmos.com/news/new-york-cosmos-join-nasl-2013|title=New York Cosmos Returns to NASL|location=New York City|work=nycosmos.com|publisher=New York Cosmos|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league also met with other prospective ownership groups for a New York expansion team.&lt;ref name="Straus 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2011-10-26/chuck-blazer-group-emerges-to-rival-cosmos-bid-for-mls-team-in-new-york-city|title= Rival emerges in Cosmos' bid to land MLS expansion team|date=October 26, 2011|first=Brian|last=Straus|work=Sporting News|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, MLS held talks with [[New York Mets]] owner [[Fred Wilpon]].&lt;ref name="Sports.espn.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cosmos_return"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/mls-focused-making-ny-club-its-20th-team |title=MLS focused on making NY club its 20th team |date=November 16, 2010|work=mlssoccer.com|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pielke, Jr.]], a noted author, professor, and chair of the Sports Governance Center in the Department of Athletics at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], confirms that Soccer United Marketing, as the marketing arm of Major League Soccer, is affiliated with the [[United States Soccer Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccernomics-agency.com/?p=973|title=Soccernomics Agency: Consultancy, Research, Ideas   » US Soccer and Conflicts of Interest|website=www.soccernomics-agency.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the relationship between Soccer United Marketing and United States Soccer Federation,  Roger A. Pielke, Jr. writes that the United States Soccer Federation "exempts from its conflict of interest policy 'any constituent or affiliated member entities of U.S. Soccer'”, which includes Major League Soccer and Soccer United Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccernomics-agency.com/?p=973|title=Soccernomics Agency: Consultancy, Research, Ideas   » US Soccer and Conflicts of Interest|website=www.soccernomics-agency.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger A. Pielke, Jr.]] writes, sourcing the New York Daily news, that this conflict of interest exemption allowed [[Sunil Gulati]] to become President of the United States Soccer Federation while also being a "founder, board member, and deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer, and a member of Soccer United Marketing's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccernomics-agency.com/?p=973|title=Soccernomics Agency: Consultancy, Research, Ideas   » US Soccer and Conflicts of Interest|website=www.soccernomics-agency.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://interactive.nydailynews.com/2016/03/how-us-soccer-mistreats-world-cup-winning-womens-national-team/|title=How US Soccer mistreats World Cup-winning Women’s National Team|website=interactive.nydailynews.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the relationship between Major League Soccer and the United States Soccer Federation, MLS Commissioner and Soccer United Marketing CEO Don Garber told [[Sports Illustrated]], " [[Sunil Gulati|Sunil]] and Dan (Flynn) had this view that as the governing body of the sport they would make commitments on the commercial side and on the competitive side to have MLS be the leader of the sport." He continued to say, "That’s not something that exists in other parts of the world. I believe that [[Sunil Gulati|Sunil]] could have made a different decision when he came in as president (in 2006), and had he made that decision MLS isn’t what it is today. Because we are joined at the hip.”

Similarly describing the relationship between  Soccer United Marketing and the United States Soccer Federation, USSF President [[Sunil Gulati]] said, "The growth of the game goes hand in hand with what the league has done over the last 16 years and the growth of so much of what’s going on in U.S. Soccer. The working relationship between the two is extraordinary and my guess is there aren’t many in the world that are like that. We don’t have the sorts of conflicts you see between leagues and federations – that’s a plus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2013/06/07/sunil-gulatis-steady-rise-biggest-challenge-still-come-word|title=Sunil Gulati's steady rise, with the biggest challenge still to come|last=Boehm|first=Charles|date=2016-06-07|website=mlssoccer.com|publisher=Major League Soccer|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soccer United Marketing and the United States Soccer Federation have played a key role in cementing Major League Soccer as the first division of professional closed-league soccer in America, which the Professional Council of United States Soccer Federation describes as "a unique ownership and operating structure, based on a 'single entity' concept." The Professional Council goes on to explain that "MLS' 'single entity' structure allows investors to own an interest in the league, as well as individual teams."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/about/affiliates/professional-soccer|title=Professional Council|website=www.ussoccer.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MLS Reserve League''' was a [[association football|soccer]] league for the [[reserve team]]s of [[Major League Soccer]] with teams in both the United States and Canada.

It was inaugurated on April 9, 2005, with the first official reserve game being a 2–0 victory by [[Chivas USA]] over the host [[San Jose Earthquakes]]. The reserve division disbanded after the 2008 season, but returned in 2011 with 18 clubs split into East, Central, and West divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commissioner-reveals-details-reserve-division Commissioner reveals details of Reserve Division]&lt;/ref&gt; Each club played ten games consisting of home-and-away matches versus each of its five divisional opponents.

In 2013, the schedule of the MLS Reserve League was integrated with the schedule of the [[USL Pro]], with teams from each league playing each other.&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Deal"/&gt;

==Format==

===2005–2008===
* Each MLS franchise fielded a reserve division team and played a 12-game schedule (six home, six away). All teams played a minimum of seven opposing reserve division teams at least once throughout the year. The reserve division standings consisted of a single table with the team that finished in first place at the end of the regular season earning the title of reserve division champions and a $20,000 team bonus.
* A total of 20 eligible players for the home team and 20 players for the visiting team could be placed on a club's game roster for any Reserve Division game with each team permitted to make up to six substitutions.
* Suspensions attributable to yellow and red cards issued in Reserve Division games would only be imposed for future Reserve Division matches and not for games during the MLS regular season. Similarly, suspensions attributable to yellow and red cards issued during MLS regular season games would not apply to Reserve Division matches.
* Any player who received four yellow cards during the Reserve Division season would be suspended from the next Reserve Division game in which he could appear.
* No player could play more than 120 minutes in a Reserve Team match and any preceding match(es) that occur within a 60-hour period. Injury time is not considered a part of a player's maximum number of minutes played (e.g., if a player enters a game at halftime and the referee adds 2 minutes of stoppage time to the end of the second half, the player will be considered to have played 45 minutes since the 2 minutes of stoppage time is essentially added to make up for 'lost' time).
* A Reserve Division call-up or "Guest Player" with an MLS team could be eligible to appear in an MLS Reserve Division Game provided that he is properly registered with U.S. Soccer.

===2011&amp;ndash;12===
* Teams face all but two conference opponents once at home and once away.  The two matches with a USL Pro side count towards the 14 match season, therefore removing two games with MLS reserve sides.
* Teams may at their discretion schedule additional exhibition games for their reserve squads against non-MLS opponents.
* At the conclusion of the Reserve League season, the team with the most points out of all three conferences will be determined the Reserve League Champion.
* All players appearing on an MLS club's roster may represent their team in MLS Reserve League play; however, no player may play more than 120 minutes in a reserve team match and any preceding matches that occur within a sixty-hour period.  Further, no player may play more than a combined total of 90 minutes in a Reserve Team Match and any preceding matches that occurred within 36 hours prior to such reserve team match.
* Clubs may also use up to five academy players per reserve game.
* A Reserve League call-up or "Trialist Player" with a club may appear in reserve league games provided that he is properly registered with US Soccer.  A representative from the MLS Club must also certify that the trialist is a bona fide professional soccer player. Trialists may participate in a maximum of two games per club per season.
* Clubs may play up to a maximum of five non-MLS Roster players per Reserve League Game.  Within the five non-MLS roster player limit, only three players may be trialist players.

===2013===
In early 2013, USL and MLS reached an agreement to integrate [[USL Pro|USL]] league competition with MLS Reserves to increase the amount of exposure to real game situations by MLS team members who do not get much time in MLS competitions or provide a USL team at which future MLS players can develop.  This multi-year deal is expected to lead to more games for both MLS Reserves and USL Pro teams.&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Deal"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/01/23/mls-usl-pro-reach-deal-restructured-reserve-league| title=MLS, USL Pro reach deal on restructured Reserve League| publisher=www.mlssoccer.com| date=January 23, 2013| accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS Reserve teams compiled a 6 Win, 9 Tie and 11 Loss record against USL Pro Teams in 2013.&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Results"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/scripts/runisa.dll?M2.66006:gp:440822.972:72011+Elements/Display+E+47107+++++58092584+++786095+Y| title=USL Pro 2013 Schedule| publisher=United Soccer Leagues (USL)| date=September 8, 2013| accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Results_2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2014-reserve-league-schedule| title=2014 Reserve League Schedule| publisher=www.mlssoccer.com| date=March 8, 2014| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
2014 was the final Reserve League season. Starting in 2015, MLS clubs must either affiliate with a USL Pro club or create their own team in the USL Pro. The LA Galaxy Reserve Team joined USL Pro as the [[LA Galaxy II]] in 2014 and finished third.

MLS Reserve teams compiled a 9 Win, 5 Tie and 14 Loss record against USL Pro teams in 2014.

'''Professional Referee Organization''' ('''PRO''') is the organization responsible for managing the [[referee (association football)|referee]] and [[assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]] program in professional [[association football|soccer]] leagues in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], working alongside the [[United States Soccer Federation]], [[Major League Soccer]], the [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the [[North American Soccer League]], the [[United Soccer League]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[U.S. Open Cup|Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]].

The organization’s targets are to increase the quality of officiating in U.S. and Canadian professional leagues, develop more professional-quality officials at a younger age, and produce officials who will represent the United States and Canada in [[FIFA]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proreferees.com/about-pro/|title=About PRO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer Federation]] and [[Major League Soccer]] joined forces in 2012 to create the Professional Referee Organization and the aims for PRO is to develop a higher standard of officiating at a younger age and to produce referees who can represent the United States and Canada in [[FIFA]] competitions.

Then U.S. Soccer President [[Sunil Gulati]] said: “We’ve always understood that the development of referees is an important aspect to the growth of the game in the [[United States]].

“PRO is another step toward the improvement and professionalization of our top referees. With the additional resources and funding provided by the formation of PRO, we will continue to build upon the progress we’ve already made.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sbisoccer.com/2012/03/us-soccer-mls-creates-new-referee-program|title=U.S. Soccer, MLS create new referee program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Major League Soccer}}

{{see also|Soccer in Canada|Soccer in the United States}}
Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national [[soccer]] leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html|title=By The Numbers… North American Soccer League vs Major League Soccer|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212061104/http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html|archivedate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[U.S. Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.&lt;ref name="leagle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/200022797FSupp2d130_1215|title=FRASER v.

MLS began play in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] with ten teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]] defeated [[D.C. United]] before 31,000 fans at [[CEFCU Stadium|Spartan Stadium]] in San Jose in a game broadcast on ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/04/9/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/MLS-KICKS-OFF-TO-FESTIVE-CROWD-MIXED-ON-FIELD-REVIEWS.aspx?hl=MLS&amp;sc=0|title=MLS KICKS OFF TO FESTIVE CROWD, MIXED ON-FIELD REVIEWS|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403003646/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/04/9/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/MLS-KICKS-OFF-TO-FESTIVE-CROWD-MIXED-ON-FIELD-REVIEWS.aspx?hl=MLS&amp;sc=0|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS—including U.S. stars such as [[Alexi Lalas]], [[Tony Meola]] and [[Eric Wynalda]], and foreign players such as Mexico's [[Jorge Campos]] and Colombia's [[Carlos Valderrama]].&lt;ref&gt;"19 Teams with 1 Goal: A Spotlight on Major League Soccer", June 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
D.C. United won the [[MLS Cup]] in three of the league's first four seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcunited.com/club/trophy-case|title=Trophy Case|work=D.C.

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/|title=Resurgence and Expansion of the MLS|work=Soccer Politics / The Politics of Football|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209173530/https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/|archivedate=December 9, 2014|date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large [[American football]] stadiums.&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;
One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to "Americanize" the sport. The league implemented the use of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootouts]] to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/1999/11/18/wednesday_teleconference/|title=Shootout banned; TV lineup changed|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221144053/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/1999/11/18/wednesday_teleconference/|archivedate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's quality was cast into doubt when the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national team]], which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;

Major League Soccer lost an estimated $250&amp;nbsp;million during its first five years, and more than $350&amp;nbsp;million between its founding and 2004.&lt;ref name=profit&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Stanley |title=Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=November 22, 2004 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer:%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628194808/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer%3A%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html |title=For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder |work=The New York Times |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220211629/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html |archivedate=December 20, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|title=MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115539/http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|title=MLS considering weight-loss program|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211173513/http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|archivedate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's financial problems led to Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] being replaced by [[Don Garber]], a former NFL executive, in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan|title=Mls Boots Commissioner, Turns To Nfl For Successor|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505072549/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan|archivedate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following decreased attendance and increased losses by late 2001, league officials planned to fold but were able to secure new financing from owners [[Lamar Hunt]], [[Philip Anschutz]], and the [[Kraft Group|Kraft family]] to take on more teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baxter |first=Kevin |date=December 5, 2015 |title=MLS goes from near extinction to remarkable success |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-soccer-baxter-20151206-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion]], leaving the league with ten teams.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/01/05/throw-did-eliminating-tampa-miami-save-mls|title=The Throw-In: Did eliminating Tampa, Miami save MLS?|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918025920/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/01/05/throw-did-eliminating-tampa-miami-save-mls|archivedate=September 18, 2014|date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the league's resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as [[Mapfre Stadium]], was built in 1999, becoming MLS's first [[soccer-specific stadium]].&lt;ref name="Columbus Crew history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/columbus|title=Columbus Crew history|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030033126/http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/columbus|archivedate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3476449|title=Making Soccer 'Major League' in the USA and Beyond:Major League Soccer's First Decade|journal=Sport History Review|volume=45|issue=1|pages=23–36|accessdate=September 20, 2014|last1=Club|first1=Tennessee Smokies Baseball|last2=Nauright|first2=John|last3=Parrish|first3=Charles|last4=Strutner|first4=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS's policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', 97 F.Supp.2d 130 ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|D. Mass]] 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence===
The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], in which the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] unexpectedly made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS.&lt;ref name="nycfc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycfc.com/Fans/Learn-about-MLS |title=Learn about MLS |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720230433/http://www.nycfc.com/fans/learn-about-mls |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |publisher=New York City FC |accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MLS Cup 2002]] drew 61,316 spectators to [[Gillette Stadium]], the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final until [[2018 MLS Cup|2018]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |title=MLS Cup 2002 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516201220/http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |archivedate=May 16, 2013  |date=October 20, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) rules in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exittheforest.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/formatting-mls-part-4-global-tradition-american-appeal/|title=Formatting MLS, Part 4: Global Tradition, American Appeal|work=Waldlichtung|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814155539/http://exittheforest.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/formatting-mls-part-4-global-tradition-american-appeal/|archivedate=August 14, 2014|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, [[Tim Howard]] was transferred to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yanks-abroad.com/content.php?mode=players&amp;id=11|title=Tim Howard club career|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008055145/http://www.yanks-abroad.com/content.php?mode=players&amp;id=11|archivedate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=March 24, 2015 |title=Americans in the Premier League -- why have numbers dropped recently? |url=http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2331121/americans-in-the-premier-league----why-have-numbers-dropped-recently |publisher=ESPN FC |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202013152/http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2331121/americans-in-the-premier-league----why-have-numbers-dropped-recently |archivedate=February 2, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6435726/rsl-jason-kreis-to-prove|title=Jason Kreis still has something to prove|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224105448/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6435726/rsl-jason-kreis-to-prove|archivedate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.&lt;ref name="Last Word On Sports"/&gt;

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Chivas USA]] began play in [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]], with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2012/9/27/3415314/real-salt-lake-vs-chivas-usa-expansion-rivalry-a-history-lesson|title=Real Salt Lake vs. Chivas USA – Expansion rivalry a history lesson|date=September 28, 2012|work=RSL Soapbox|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043328/http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2012/9/27/3415314/real-salt-lake-vs-chivas-usa-expansion-rivalry-a-history-lesson|archivedate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion [[Houston Dynamo]], after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/history#2006|title=Quakes History|work=San Jose Earthquakes|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923142115/http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/history#2006|archivedate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Designated Players===
[[File:Red Bull Arena on the First Day.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New York Red Bulls' soccer-specific stadium, [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]].]]
In 2007 the league expanded beyond the United States' borders into Canada with the [[Toronto FC]] expansion team.&lt;ref name=Expansion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timbers.com/news/2010/11/mls-101-mls-expansion-draft-and-allocation-money|title=MLS 101: MLS Expansion Draft and Allocation Money|work=Portland Timbers|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213229/http://www.timbers.com/news/2010/11/mls-101-mls-expansion-draft-and-allocation-money|archivedate=August 12, 2014|date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major League Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the [[Designated Player Rule]], which helped bring international stars into the league.&lt;ref name="forbes-2014-09"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2012/08/05/has-the-beckham-rule-worked-for-mls/ |title=Has The 'Beckham Rule' Worked For MLS? |date=August 5, 2012  |first=Bobby |last=McMahon |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924164245/http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2012/08/05/has-the-beckham-rule-worked-for-mls/ |archivedate=September 24, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Ownership===
{{See also|Major League Soccer owners}}
Major League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business of Soccer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/2014/2/28/5456444/roundtable-is-mls-single-entity-here-to-stay|title=Roundtable: Is MLS Single Entity Here To Stay?|date=February 28, 2014|work=Hot Time in Old Town|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031111538/http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/2014/2/28/5456444/roundtable-is-mls-single-entity-here-to-stay|archivedate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/about-major-league-soccer |title=About Major League Soccer |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |quote=Major League Soccer is structured as a single, limited liability company (single-entity). In the single-entity business structure, club operators own a financial stake in the League, not just their individual team. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424164602/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/about-major-league-soccer |archivedate=April 24, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt; The court also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;

Having multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league's first ten years.&lt;ref name="latimes2006"/&gt; At one time [[Phil Anschutz]]'s AEG operated six MLS franchises and [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator.&lt;ref name="Contraction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season|title=Major League Soccer Announces Elimination of Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion for 2002 Season|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082916/http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season|archivedate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of [[Soccer United Marketing]], and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.&lt;ref name="Contraction"/&gt;

MLS salaries are limited by a [[Salary cap#Major League Soccer|salary cap]], which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.&lt;ref name="leagle.com"/&gt; The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'' lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team.&lt;ref name="Major League Soccer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pressbox2015/&gt;

Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two [[transfer window]]s—the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August.&lt;ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|title=Roster Rules and Regulations|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920193128/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|archivedate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2016/08/02/israeli-club-ups-offer-for-d-c-uniteds-steve-birnbaum-but/ |title=Israeli club ups offer for D.C.

MLS teams have a limited number of [[MLS International Roster Slots|international roster slots]] that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story|title=ASN article: MLS Allure: Why Wages Are Only Part of the Story|accessdate=September 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916192944/http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story|archivedate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers|title=Recent analysis of foreign player pool in MLS reveals interesting numbers|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912153409/http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers|archivedate=September 12, 2015|date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america|title=MLS remains most diverse professional sports league in North America|work=LA Galaxy|accessdate=April 24, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222317/http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america|archivedate=April 25, 2015|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Pat |title=MLS comes out of the gates strong in '07 |publisher=monstersandcritics.com |date=May 4, 2007 |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-mls/misc/mls_features_archive/mls_features_archive_050407.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524072946/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=soc-mls%2Fmisc%2Fmls_features_archive%2Fmls_features_archive_050407.htm |archivedate=May 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

The [[Designated Player Rule|designated player (DP) rule]] allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap, each DP player only counts as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap in 2017. Instituted in 2007, England's [[David Beckham]] was the first signing under the DP rule.&lt;ref name="forbes-2014-09"/&gt; The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum.&lt;ref name="2014-salaries-mlsplayers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201,%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |title=2014 MLS Player Salaries: April 1, 2014: By Club |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |publisher=Major League Soccer Players Union |date=April 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618064130/http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201%2C%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |archivedate=June 18, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2013 season 21% of the league's wage spending went to just 5 players, this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |title=A Look at Income Inequality in MLS |work=Empire of Soccer |first=Bill |last=Reese |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726234141/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |archivedate=July 26, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |date=April 11, 2014 |first=Steve |last=Fenn |title=2014 MLS Salaries Visualized |publisher=StatHunting |accessdate=September 20, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712170437/http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |archivedate=July 12, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

MLS has introduced various initiatives and rules intended to develop young players. Rules concerning Generation Adidas players and home grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop and retain young players.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics.com"/&gt;

Players under the Home Grown Player rule are signed to Generation Adidas contracts,&lt;ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations"/&gt; all players on Generation Adidas contracts are "off budget players" and their salaries do not count against the cap.

MLS formerly operated a [[MLS Reserve League|reserve league]] that gave playing time to players who were not starters for their MLS teams. The Reserve League was formed in 2005, and operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 &amp; 2010 seasons).&lt;ref&gt;MLSsoccer.com, [http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commissioner-reveals-details-reserve-division "Commissioner reveals details of Reserve Division"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120213608/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commissioner-reveals-details-reserve-division |date=November 20, 2010 }}, November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as USL Pro in 2013,&lt;ref name="MLS_USL_Deal"&gt;{{cite news |  url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/01/23/mls-usl-pro-reach-deal-restructured-reserve-league |  title=MLS, USL Pro reach deal on restructured Reserve League | work=MLSsoccer.com |  date=January 23, 2013 |  accessdate=January 27, 2013 |  url-status=live |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126060258/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/01/23/mls-usl-pro-reach-deal-restructured-reserve-league |  archivedate=January 26, 2013 |  df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, with MLS now requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or field their own reserve side in that league.

The development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress.  D.C. United had played their home games at former NFL and Major League Baseball venue [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017,  D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, [[Audi Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/soccer-insider/wp/2014/12/17/d-c-united-stadium-approval-improves-its-playing-field-in-mls-in-many-ways/ |title=D.C.

Two teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home games at [[Yankee Stadium]], a Major League Baseball venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the future. The New England Revolution play home games at a National Football League venue, [[Gillette Stadium]], but are currently in discussion with the City of [[Boston]] regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in [[South Boston]].&lt;ref name="Boston Globe 2014"&gt;''Boston Globe'',{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/18/krafts-exploring-soccer-stadium-boston/s7p5krvDeH1J7UgjlEIFtM/story.html |title=Kraft family looks to build soccer stadium in Boston |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121103133/http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/18/krafts-exploring-soccer-stadium-boston/s7p5krvDeH1J7UgjlEIFtM/story.html |archivedate=November 21, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders FC play at [[CenturyLink Field]], a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer.

Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS's financial security.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs.&lt;ref name="Forbes, Major League Soccer 2013"/&gt;

Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league's early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with [[ESPN]] spanning the 2007–2014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees, reported to be worth $7–8&amp;nbsp;million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2006/08/Issue-216/Sports-Media/ESPN-MLS-Reach-Eight-Year-TV-Deal-That-Includes-Rights-Fees.aspx|title=ESPN, MLS Reach Eight-Year TV Deal That Includes Rights Fees|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224183626/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2006/08/Issue-216/Sports-Media/ESPN-MLS-Reach-Eight-Year-TV-Deal-That-Includes-Rights-Fees.aspx|archivedate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media rights agency MP &amp; Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10&amp;nbsp;million annually.

In early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship deal with Adidas.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer.

By 2012 the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' published a report that revealed that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's collective annual revenues were $494&amp;nbsp;million, and that the league's collective annual profit was $34&amp;nbsp;million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to be worth $103&amp;nbsp;million on average, almost three times as much as the $37&amp;nbsp;million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175&amp;nbsp;million, a 483% gain over the $30&amp;nbsp;million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 ''Forbes'' updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million.&lt;ref name="forbes-2015-08"/&gt;

As of 2018 ''Forbes'' estimates Atlanta United FC are the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2018/11/14/mls-most-valuable-teams-2018/?src=rss|title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams 2018: Atlanta United Debuts On Top
|last=Smith|first=Chris|work=Forbes|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs.

MLS teams typically use commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four [[charter flight]]s allowed under league rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karstens-Smith |first=Gemma |date=April 26, 2019 |title=Montreal Impact, Vancouver Whitecaps voice concerns about Major League Soccer travel woes |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-montreal-impact-vancouver-whitecaps-voice-concerns-about-major-league/ |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules and officials===
MLS follows the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules and standards]] of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).
The playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] if necessary.

[[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league's "Game First" initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Game First' initiatives enhance on-field product |publisher=Major League Soccer Communications |date=April 2, 2007 |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&amp;content_id=87043&amp;vkey=pr_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |accessdate=May 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426134827/http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&amp;content_id=87043&amp;vkey=pr_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |archivedate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Major League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new rule was [[Charlie Davies]], fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|title=MLS Disciplinary Committee fines Davies for dive vs. RSL|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230231605/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|archivedate=December 30, 2014|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team names===
:''For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.''

In the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., [[Columbus Crew]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[New England Revolution]]). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] team names [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974–88)|San Jose Earthquakes]], [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]], [[Portland Timbers (1975–82)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974–84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346|title=Toye: Fans are delighted the old NASL names, Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps and Quakes were saved|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202155940/http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346|archivedate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN, FS1, and Univision share in coverage of the playoffs, while ABC and FOX alternate broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches are aired per-season across all three networks. The three contracts have an average estimated value of $90 million per season—five times larger than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, Univision, and [[NBC Sports]].&lt;ref name=philly-espnfs1mls&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC to end MLS deal in 2015; ESPN, Fox pay $70 million per year for new rights package|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/NBC-to-lose-MLS-rights-in-2015-ESPN-Fox-likely-to-share-new-deal.html|work=The Goalkeeper|accessdate=February 3, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114221044/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/NBC-to-lose-MLS-rights-in-2015-ESPN-Fox-likely-to-share-new-deal.html|archivedate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's more evidence that Americans are growing fond of soccer|url=http://qz.com/208672/heres-more-evidence-that-americans-are-growing-fond-of-soccer/#/h/68308,1/|accessdate=May 18, 2014|newspaper=Quartz|date=May 12, 2014|author=John McDuling|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517021121/http://qz.com/208672/heres-more-evidence-that-americans-are-growing-fond-of-soccer/#/h/68308,1/|archivedate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;&lt;ref name=sbj-bigplay&gt;{{cite web|title=MLS's big play|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx?_ga=1.45967076.1328930521.1404086578|work=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=June 30, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715015235/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/05/12/Media/MLS-TV.aspx?_ga=1.45967076.1328930521.1404086578|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-newcontract&gt;{{cite news|title=M.L.S. and TV Networks Reach Deal to Set Weekly Slots for Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/sports/soccer/mls-and-tv-networks-reach-deal-to-set-weekly-slots-for-games.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513214511/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/sports/soccer/mls-and-tv-networks-reach-deal-to-set-weekly-slots-for-games.html?_r=0|archivedate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mls-newdeal2015&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN, Fox and Univision promise new emphasis to domestic game, MLS in landmark eight-year TV deal|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/05/12/espn-fox-and-univision-promise-new-emphasis-domestic-game-mls-landmark-eight|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=May 13, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513163155/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/05/12/espn-fox-and-univision-promise-new-emphasis-domestic-game-mls-landmark-eight|archivedate=May 13, 2014|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2011/08/23/2632284/business-off-the-pitch-breakdown-of-major-league-soccers|title=Business Off The Pitch: Breakdown of Major League Soccer's Broadcast Partners|work=Goal.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216190536/http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2011/08/23/2632284/business-off-the-pitch-breakdown-of-major-league-soccers|archivedate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matches not televised nationally are broadcast regionally, often by [[regional sports networks]] like [[Fox Sports Networks]], [[Comcast SportsNet]], [[Spectrum Sports]] and [[Root Sports]], and sometimes by terrestrial stations like [[KTXA]], [[WRDQ]] anad [[KMYU]].&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt; Regionally televised matches are available outside their local markets on [[ESPN+]].

Coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007 with the addition of Toronto FC.
Currently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are held by the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] networks through a five-year deal first renewed in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34900">The '''Major League Soccer Caribbean Combine''' is an annual showcase of [[Caribbean]] [[association football|football]] talent between the ages of 18-21 organized jointly by [[Major League Soccer]] and the [[Caribbean Football Union]] in 2013, with the inaugural combine being held in January 2014. All 31 member associations are encouraged to send representatives that fit the criteria.  The combine provides opportunities for Caribbean players to be observed by MLS scouts with the hopes of being invited to the [[MLS Combine]], an invite-only showcase event held in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] prior to the annual [[MLS SuperDraft]]. The combine is part of an agreement between the two entities as they try to promote football development throughout the Caribbean region. About the impact of Caribbean players on the league, MLS Technical Director Alfonso Mondelo said, "Quite a few players have played, continue to play in the MLS and have done so successfully...Now we are looking forward to the next generation of players who will be coming in", while MLS Executive Vice President Todd Durbin said, "We recognize that the [[CONCACAF]] area, and particularly the Caribbean, is rich with soccer talent, and this will be an opportunity for our scouts to evaluate and identify the region’s top players...Caribbean players from islands like [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Grenada]] and others have been key performers in MLS. This event will help recognize the next generation of MLS stars as we look to achieve our goal of being among the best leagues in the world by 2022." From a Caribbean perspective, CFU President [[Gordon Derrick]] stated, "As CFU Member Associations turn their attention to [[2018 FIFA World Cup|Russia 2018]], this is an exciting developmental opportunity for the opulent young talent in the Caribbean to assess their developmental level and the growth required to play at the highest level...This partnership with MLS is another way in which we at the CFU are seeking to bridge the gap that exists between talent availability and scouting opportunities that the Caribbean region has received from professional leagues."&lt;ref name="CFU, MLS ink partnership agreement"&gt;{{cite web|title=CFU, MLS ink partnership agreement|url=http://www.concacaf.com/article/cfu-mls-ink-partnership-agreement|publisher=CONCACAF|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Major League Soccer partners with Caribbean Football Union to host first-ever Caribbean Player Combine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major League Soccer partners with Caribbean Football Union to host first-ever Caribbean Player Combine|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/major-league-soccer-partners-caribbean-football-union-host-first-ever-caribbean-player|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2014 Caribbean Combine''' took place at the [[Antigua Recreation Ground]] in St. John’s, Antigua from January 2–4; and featured 24 players from 16 different Caribbean nations.

==2016==
The 2016 edition of the MLS Caribbean Combine was held on three different islands at different times, unlike previous years in which it was held at a central location. Players were invited to specific host islands based up their country of origin. Twenty four players were invited to each location for a total of 72 players, a significant increase over previous years. The reason for decentralizing the combine was to make it easier for more nations to participate.&lt;ref name="2015/2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 MLS Combine to be held across three islands|url=http://cfufootball.org/index.php/men-s-u20/9763-2015-mls-combine-to-be-held-across-three-islands|publisher=Caribbean Football Union|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017==
In October 2016 it was announced that the base of the 2017 MLS Caribbean Combine would be merged with the final round of CFU [[2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualifying|2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualification]] taking place that same month. The qualifiers would be attended directly by scouts from MLS teams, with representatives from at least the [[Philadelphia Union]], [[Real Salt Lake]], and [[Seattle Sounders FC]] confirmed to attend. The decision to combine the two events was logistical since many of the region's best young players and national teams from the desired age group would be participating.&lt;ref name="CFU U-20 Qualifiers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual MLS-CFU Combine merges with CFU U-20 Qualifiers|url=http://www.cfufootball.org/index.php/men-s-u20/9885-annual-mls-cfu-combine-merges-with-cfu-u-20-qualifiers|publisher=Caribbean Football Union|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new format meant that players from nations that were not part of the competition would not have the opportunity to be scouted at this edition of the combine.&lt;ref name="COMBINE CHANGES FORMAT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webster|first1=Jade|title=MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER CARIBBEAN COMBINE CHANGES FORMAT|url=http://cayman27.ky/2016/10/major-league-soccer-caribbean-combine-changes-format/|publisher=Cayman 27|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018==
The combine returned to a single-venue, invite-only format in 2018. This edition of the combine was the first held outside of the Caribbean with the three-day event taking place at the Sawgrass Hotel and Suites Sports Complex outside of [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]] from January 9–11, 2018. Chosen invitees will then attend the MLS Player Combine from January 11–17 in [[Orlando]]. In total, 22 players were invited to attend the event.&lt;ref name="2018 Caribbean Combine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stejskal|first1=Sam|title=MLS invites 22 players to 2018 Caribbean Combine|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/12/18/mls-invites-22-players-2018-caribbean-combine|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, no players from the Caribbean Combine were invited to the MLS Combine.&lt;ref name="Combine rosters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baer|first1=Benjamin|title=Combine rosters, schedule|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/01/11/edward-opoku-added-generation-adidas-class-combine-rosters-schedule|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David H. Mincberg''' is the Director of Basketball Strategy for the Milwaukee Bucks (National Basketball Association). 

==Biography==
Mincberg has a law degree from the University of California Berkeley and worked on the acquisitions of both the Memphis Grizzlies and D.C. United ([[Major League Soccer]]) before serving as the in-house counsel for both organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/about/grizzlies_directory.html |title=Memphis Grizzlies and FedExForum Directory &amp;#124; THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES |publisher=Nba.com |date=2013-03-16 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as team counsel for [[D.C. United]], Mincberg was tasked with negotiating a deal to secure a new stadium for D.C. United, which would allow the franchise to remain in D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Straus |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2013-02-15/as-dc-uniteds-quest-for-new-stadium-progresses-club-abandons-baltimore-option |title=As D.C. United’s quest for new stadium progresses, club abandons Baltimore option - SOCCER |publisher=Sporting News |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, after working closely with City Administrator Allen Lew, Mincberg helped DC United strike a deal with the city of Washington, D.C. that was heralded as "likely to give (the) franchise the kick it needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/new-dc-united-stadium-likely-to-give-franchise-the-kick-it-needs/2013/07/24/2f8feb22-f473-11e2-a2f1-a7acf9bd5d3a_story.html |title=New D.C. United stadium likely to give franchise the kick it needs |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as team counsel for the Memphis Grizzlies, Mincberg was involved with the team's business operations, basketball operations, and ownership group. He played an active role in the team's player personnel decisions, draft process, and scouting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/grizzlies/media/2013-14MemphisGrizzlies.pdf |title=Grizzlies Media Guide |publisher=I.cdn.turner.com |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mincberg has also contributed to the field of Sports Law through his writing. His article, "Guns, Collective Bargaining and Moral Turpitude: [[Gilbert Arenas]] and the National Basketball Association" examined the standards by which the NBA assesses moral turpitude and whether Gilbert Arenas' contract could have been terminated on such grounds in the wake of his decision to bring a gun into the [[Washington Wizards]]' locker room.&lt;ref&gt;10 Va. Sports &amp; Ent. L.J. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Mincberg's scholarship has recently been cited by [[Westlaw]]'s treatise "The Fundamentals of Sports Law".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Sports Law § 18:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Mincberg is a native of Washington, D.C. He holds a bachelor's degree from the [[University of South Florida]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48427">The '''History of Major League Soccer''' began in 1988, when the United States Soccer Federation pledged to create a Division 1 professional soccer league as a condition to FIFA awarding the 1994 FIFA World Cup to the United States.  [[Major League Soccer]] was officially formed in 1995. The league began play in 1996 with 10 teams, and in 1998 grew to 12 teams.  MLS experienced some difficulties in its first seasons, with the league losing money in the early years, resulting in two teams folding after the 2001 season.  MLS has rebounded since then, with increased attendance and the development of [[soccer-specific stadium]]s. With an average attendance of over 20,000 per game, MLS has the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada#Attendance]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide.&lt;ref name="mlssoccer.com"&gt;MLSsoccer.com, The expansion, refs, Cascadia: MLS Commissioner Don Garber covers it all in annual address, February 27, 2013, http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/02/27/expansion-refs-cascadia-commissioner-garber-covers-it-all-march-soccer-addre&lt;/ref&gt; MLS currently has 24 teams, with further expansion planned (30 teams).

==Background==
{{see also|Soccer in Canada|Soccer in the United States}}

Major League Soccer is the most recent of  three professional men's Division 1 national [[association football]] leagues with clubs in the United States and Canada.  In the US, with no clubs in Canada, the earliest of such leagues was the [[American Football Association]], which was formed in 1884&lt;ref&gt;Murray, C. K. (1910). "History and Progress of the AFA", ''Official Association Foot Ball Guide'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and allied with [[The Football Association]], becoming a member on February 22, 1909, at an FA meeting chaired by [[Charles Clegg (footballer)|Charles Clegg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=February 23, 1909 | title=Football: The Association Cup Draw| work=[[The Manchester Guardian]]|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate predecessor of MLS was the de facto highest level of soccer played in Division 2 [[American Professional Soccer League]] that was one of two leagues tracing their genesis to the collapse of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in 1984. The NASL [[1968 in association football|formed in 1968]] as the merger of the [[United Soccer Association]] and [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]], both of which had been formed [[1967 in association football|the year before]]. The NASL, the first league to have U.S. and Canadian professional clubs, struggled until the mid-1970s, when its average attendance had grown to 7,770, with four teams averaging over 10,000 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= North American Soccer League Statistics| url=http://www.nasljerseys.com/Stats/Standings.htm |publisher= nasljerseys.com|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASL Final 1974|1974 NASL Championship game]] between the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] and the [[Miami Toros]] was televised live on [[CBS Sports]], the first national broadcast of a pro soccer match in the United States since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher= Fun While It Lasted | title=August 25, 1974 – NASL Championship Game – Miami Toros vs. Los Angeles Aztecs | url= http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/2013/06/23/august-25-1974-nasl-championship-game-miami-toros-vs-los-angeles-aztecs/|work= [[WordPress]]| accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NASL folded after its [[1984 North American Soccer League season|1984 season]].

The other professional men's league starting after the NASL folded was the Canada-only Division 1 [[Canadian Soccer League (1987–92)|Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL), active from 1987 to 1992.  During the positioning for Division 1 status, the CSL folded and teams from the three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest Canadian metropolitan areas]], Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver joined the APSL.

==Establishment==
In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[U.S. Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.&lt;ref name="leagle.com"&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/200022797FSupp2d130_1215 FRASER v. MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER, 97 F.Supp.2d 130 (D. Mass. 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the USSF selected Major League Professional Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional soccer league. Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 1995 as a limited liability company. MLS had originally planned to begin play in 1995 with 12 teams.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Zuhosky Daily, [http://drewzuhoskydaily.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/major-league-soccer-still-big-still-bold-nearly-20-years-later/ Major League Soccer: Still Big, Still Bold, Nearly 20 Years Later] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218092356/http://drewzuhoskydaily.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/major-league-soccer-still-big-still-bold-nearly-20-years-later/ |date=2013-12-18 }}, Dec 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, MLS announced in November 1994 that it would delay its launch until 1996 and began with ten teams: [[Columbus Crew]], [[D.C. United]], [[New England Revolution]], [[New York Red Bulls|NY/NJ MetroStars]], [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]], [[Colorado Rapids]], [[Dallas Burn]], [[Kansas City Wiz]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], and [[San Jose Clash]]. The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS—including U.S. stars such as [[Alexi Lalas]], [[Tony Meola]] and [[Eric Wynalda]], and foreign players such as Mexico's [[Jorge Campos]] and Colombia's [[Carlos Valderrama]]. Before its [[1996 Major League Soccer season|maiden season]] and [[1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft|inaugural draft]], MLS [[allocation (MLS)|allocated]] four marquee players across the initial ten teams.

Major League Soccer with [[ESPN]] and [[ABC Sports]] announced the league's first television rights deal on March 15, 1994, without any players, coaches, or teams in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Pro League Moves Along By Signing a Television Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/sports/soccer-us-pro-league-moves-along-by-signing-a-television-deal.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 1994|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-year agreement covered English-language broadcasting for the 1996–1998 seasons, and committed 10 games on ESPN, 25 on [[ESPN2]], and the [[MLS Cup]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The deal gave MLS no rights fees but split advertising revenue between the league and networks. [[Univision]], [[Galavisión (USA)|Galavision]], and [[UniMás]] broadcast matches in Spanish. The original Univision deal lapsed after a few years, leaving only the ABC/ESPN networks as the league's national broadcasters.

The early years of the league gave rise to the [[Bruce Arena]]-led dynasty of D.C. United, winning the [[MLS Cup]] in three of the league's first four seasons. The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998—the [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], with the Chicago Fire winning its first title in 1998 to interrupt United's dominance of the championship.

In 1996, the players filed an antitrust lawsuit, ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', alleging that MLS's policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap was an illegal conspiracy among team owners.  The court ruled that MLS was a single entity and therefore incapable of conspiring with itself, and that the salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the League to maintain solvency and competitive parity, and avoid the problems that had plagued the defunct NASL.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', 97 F.Supp.2d 130 (D. Mass 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early difficulties==
After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance. The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams began playing in stadiums owned or rented by [[American football]] teams, most of the venues with capacities of 60,000 or more.

MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to "Americanize" what some viewed as a foreign sport. Some of these rules changes were borrowed from the original [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]], [[college soccer]] and [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school soccer]]. MLS implemented the use of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootouts]] to resolve tie games. These best-of-five contests placed a player 35 yards from goal with five seconds to put the ball past the opposing goalkeeper; if needed the shootout progressed into extra frames. A winning team received one standings point (as opposed to three for the regulation win). MLS also used a countdown clock, rather than a standard progressive clock, with time paused for dead ball situations at a referee's discretion. Halves ended when the clock reached 0:00, rather than at the whistle of the referee as was customary elsewhere.

MLS eventually conceded that the rule changes, particularly the shootout, had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans as hoped. The shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season. MLS continued to experiment with the settling of tie games in regular season play. In 2000, a 10-minute [[golden goal]] period replaced the shootout for tied games, but was abandoned after 2003 after the sudden-death rules were abolished from the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]].
 
The league's quality was cast into doubt when the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national team]], which was made up largely of MLS players, was eliminated in the first round of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] by losing to all opponents in the group stage and finishing in last place.

The league began to market itself on the talents of American players, both experienced veterans and fresh talents. Breakout stars like [[DaMarcus Beasley]] and [[Landon Donovan]] began making names for themselves in MLS before starring for the U.S. national team, while established players such as [[Brian McBride]], [[Eddie Pope]], and [[Clint Mathis]] continued to prove their value to both their MLS clubs and the U.S. national team.

The league's ongoing financial problems led to the departure of then-Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] in August 1999, with [[Don Garber]], a former National Football League executive, hired as commissioner that same month.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan Mls Boots Commissioner, Turns To Nfl For Successor], August 4, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Under Garber's auspices, [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] was built in 1999, becoming MLS's first [[soccer-specific stadium]]. This began a trend among the majority of MLS teams and owners to construct their own venues, abandoning their former stadiums whose main tenants were either professional or college [[gridiron football]] teams.

On the field, the early wave of international players who had joined MLS at its inception drifted into retirement or moved on to clubs elsewhere in the world. The run-up to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] saw a gradual shift in the league's philosophy toward the development of American talent, a move that would eventually lead to success for U.S. soccer.

Major League Soccer lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years, and lost more than $350 million between its founding and the year 2004.&lt;ref name=profit&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Stanley |title=Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch |work=Businessweek |date=November 22, 2004 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer:%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder], Nov 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The league's poor financial condition and declining attendances forced MLS to cut expenses to reduce operating losses.  Prior to the 2001 season, MLS owners agreed to freeze team budgets and refrain from signing new expensive players.&lt;ref&gt;SoccerTimes.com, [http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision], Dec 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the winter break between the 2000 and 2001 seasons, reports began circulating that MLS was considering trimming the league from 12 teams back to 10 teams.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com Soccernet, [http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html MLS considering weight-loss program]&lt;/ref&gt; MLS ultimately announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the two Florida franchises, the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]]. This left the league with 10 teams, the same number as when MLS began. Also, the league reorganized back to the Eastern and Western Conference format after two seasons with the third [[Central Division (MLS)|Central Division]].

By 2002, MLS appeared to be in poor condition. Contraction had reduced the number of teams from 12 to 10; MLS was losing money each year; a number of owners pulled out, leaving only three owners in league, with one owner Phil Anschutz owning six teams; and only one team had its own soccer-specific stadium.&lt;ref name="Out of the Darkness"/&gt;

==Resurgence==
The 2002 World Cup, in which the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] unexpectedly made the quarterfinals through wins against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS.&lt;ref name="nycfc.com"&gt;New York City FC, Learn about MLS, {{cite web |url=http://www.nycfc.com/Fans/Learn-about-MLS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-23 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720230433/http://www.nycfc.com/fans/learn-about-mls |archivedate=2014-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MLS Cup 2002]], held four months after the 2002 World Cup final, set an attendance record with 61,316 spectators at [[Gillette Stadium]] witnessing the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] win their first title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |title=MLS Cup 2002 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event held the largest crowd attendance in MLS Finals and second-highest attendance in overall domestic American soccer, after the [[Soccer Bowl '78|North American Soccer League championship in 1978]], which held nearly 75,000 at [[Giants Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;North American Soccer League Players, Standings, http://www.nasljerseys.com/Stats/Standings.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MLS adopted the IFAB rules and standards in 2003, which included changes such as limiting teams to three substitutions per game. MLS had previously allowed a fourth, goalkeeper-only substitute, but changed the rule after MetroStars coach [[Bob Bradley]] used a loophole to insert an outfield player as a fourth substitute.

MLS drew international attention in 2004 with the debut of 14-year-old [[Freddy Adu]] for D.C. United, who entered the league with much fanfare and was heralded as one of the top prospects in American soccer history.

MLS underwent a significant transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league saw some of its homegrown stars depart for more prominent leagues in Europe. [[Tim Howard]], goalkeeper for the [[MetroStars]], was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history. DaMarcus Beasley of the Chicago Fire left for [[PSV Eindhoven]], while Landon Donovan, on loan from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], was recalled to Germany. Donovan's stint in Germany was brief; before the start of the [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005 MLS season]] he was sold back to MLS to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy.

Many more American players, though they factored little in the U.S. national team picture, did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] of expansion club [[Real Salt Lake]] became the first player to score at least 100 career MLS goals. In 2005, the [[MLS Reserve Division]] was created, with each reserve squad playing 12 games, providing valuable playing time to develop non-starters on team rosters.

Part of the League's financial stabilization plan involved moving teams out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums. From 2003 to 2008, the League saw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], so that by the end of 2008, a majority of MLS teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since the contraction of 2001. [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles, sharing the [[Home Depot Center]] (now known as StubHub Center) with the Galaxy. Chivas USA also became the first team in MLS to be directly connected to a foreign club, their sister club of [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. By 2006 the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion [[Houston Dynamo]], after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that would materialize in 2007.

==2007–present==
The 2007 season was a turning point for Major League Soccer in several ways.&lt;ref name="Out of the Darkness"&gt;[http://grantland.com/the-triangle/out-of-the-darkness-how-mls-commissioner-don-garber-took-his-league-from-contraction-to-expansion/ "Out of the Darkness: How MLS Commissioner Don Garber Took His League From Contraction to Expansion"], ''Grantland'', April 8, 2014. Retrieved May 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto FC joined the league as an expansion team with sellout crowds and thousands of people on the waiting list for tickets; Stan Kroenke purchased the Colorado Rapids with a plan to build a soccer-specific stadium; and David Beckham joined MLS as the league's first designated player, drawing sellout crowds.&lt;ref name="Out of the Darkness"/&gt;

Since 2007, Major League Soccer has taken steps to raise the league's level of play and to internationalize the league. Among the first moves in this regard was the [[Designated Player Rule]], which helped MLS bring international stars into the league, despite the relatively meager MLS salary cap, and the creation of the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], which placed top MLS clubs against top Mexican clubs in an effort to provide more meaningful competition for both leagues. MLS changed the rules regarding foreign players in the league to allow a total of eight per team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Steve |title=Desire to maintain quality drives foreign player rule |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=December 26, 2007 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=493683&amp;cc=4716 |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw expansion reach beyond the United States' borders into Canada, beginning with [[Toronto FC]].

The [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 season]] witnessed the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]], whose signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer. Beckham's contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as [[Cuauhtémoc Blanco]] of [[Club América]] signed for the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], and [[Juan Pablo Ángel]], who moved from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to the [[New York Red Bulls]], are some of the first Designated Players who have made major contributions to their clubs.

The departures of [[Clint Dempsey]] and [[Jozy Altidore]], coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars [[Claudio Reyna]] and [[Brian McBride]] to New York and Chicago, respectively, highlight the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS. Several other well-known foreign players have followed Beckham and Blanco to MLS, including [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] to Columbus and [[Freddie Ljungberg]] to Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lalas |first=Greg |title=Foreign exchange program |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 17, 2007 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/greg_lalas/04/17/mls.signings/index.html |accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league announced "Game First" in 2007, a series of initiatives aimed at improving the league in several ways.  This included the creation of an official league anthem by [[Audiobrain]]&amp;mdash;similar to other competitions from around the world.

In July 2017, it was reported that Major League Soccer had rejected a $4 billion offer by [[MP &amp; Silva]] to acquire all television rights to the league for 10 years following the conclusion of its current contracts with Fox, ESPN, and Univision. While it represents a substantial increase over the current agreements, MP &amp; Silva insisted that the deal would be conditional on Major League Soccer adopting a promotion and relegation system similar to other international leagues. Although the league stated that it rejected the offer due to the exclusive periods that the current rightsholders have to negotiate extensions to their contracts, it was pointed out by the media that Major League Soccer had long-opposed the adoption of promotion and relegation, continuing to utilize the fixed, franchise-based model used in other U.S. sports leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2017/07/24/Leagues-and-Governing-Bodies/MLS.aspx|title=MLS rebuffs rich offer tied to relegation|website=Sports Business Daily|access-date=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espnfc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/3164341/was-$4b-bid-for-mls-media-rights-tied-to-adopting-pro-rel-grandstanding|title=Pro/rel component made $4B bid for MLS media rights a non-starter|work=ESPNFC.com|access-date=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, MP &amp; Silva founder [[Riccardo Silva]] appeared to have a conflict of interest because he also owned [[Miami FC]] of the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]], which stood to benefit from such a promotion and relegation system.&lt;ref name="espnfc"/&gt;

'''''Fraser v. Major League Soccer''''', 284 [[F.3d]] 47 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|1st Cir.]] 2002),&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v. Major League Soccer |vol=284 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=47 |court=1st Cir. |date=2002 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/284/47/495459/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust suit]] filed by eight [[Major League Soccer]] players against MLS, the league's investors, and the [[United States Soccer Federation]]. The Court found that Major League Soccer was a single entity and therefore legally incapable of conspiring with itself.

==Arguments==
Through the [[Sherman Act|Sherman]] and [[Clayton Act]]s, the plaintiffs claimed that MLS and its investors acting as a single entity unlawfully lessens the value of players' services and that MLS and the USSF conspired to monopolize the [[United States soccer pyramid|Division 1]] professional soccer market.

Major League Soccer – through precedence set in ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.|Copperweld v. Independence Tube]]'' – argued that as a single entity with its investors, it could not conspire with itself because it functioned as a single business enterprise.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt; MLS argued that controlling player salaries was critical to MLS's success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brief for Defendants Major League Soccer LLC, et al, 2001 WL 36006544&lt;/ref&gt;

==District Court and Trial==
The players filed their lawsuit in the fall of 1996, and the Court held summary judgment hearings in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v. Major League Soccer |vol=7 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=73 |pinpoint= |court=D. Mass. |date=1998 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/7/73/2577557/ |accessdate=2018-03-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court ruled in summary judgment on April 19, 2000 that MLS was a single entity and therefore cannot conspire with its investors and its investors cannot conspire with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Fraser v. Major League Soccer |vol=97 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=130 |pinpoint= |court=D. Mass. |date=2000 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/97/130/2339810/ |accessdate=2018-03-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial was held during the fall of 2000. Testimony included Deputy Commissioner [[Ivan Gazidis]], who testified on behalf of MLS that "the biggest challenge we have as a league is keeping our talented players within the league and not having them leave us for other opportunities overseas."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Each of the eight players who were plaintiffs conceded that he had played non Division 1 professional soccer at some point in his career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The jury found that MLS competes for player services with soccer leagues other than Division 1, and MLS competes with soccer leagues in other countries, meaning that MLS could not be found guilty of monopolizing a market for Division player services in the U.S.

==Court of Appeals==
The Court of Appeals upheld the district court's prior ruling that MLS is a single entity only in that it acts as a "single economic actor" and may continue to sign players under its current system. However, the decision also distinguished MLS from ''Copperweld'' and remained intentionally inconclusive as to whether the league's corporate structure really qualifies as a true single entity. The court concluded that "MLS and its operator/investors comprise a hybrid arrangement, somewhere between a single company…and  a  cooperative  arrangement  between  existing competitors."&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;

The Court of Appeals upheld the jury's finding that the plaintiffs did not prove that Major League Soccer illegally monopolized the market for player services, and failed to prove the product market and geographic market, because MLS competed with other soccer leagues in the U.S. for players, and MLS competed with soccer leagues in other countries.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;

On the charge of a reduction in competition under the Clayton Act, the Court of Appeals held that "the creation of MLS did not reduce competition in an existing market" because no active market for Division 1 soccer previously existed in the United States.&lt;ref name=fraser /&gt;

The '''MLS Players Association''', also referred to as the '''MLSPA''', is the [[trade union|union]] of professional [[Major League Soccer]] players.  The MLS Players Association serves as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all current players in MLS.

==History==
The MLS Players Association (formerly MLS Players Union)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mlsplayers.org/news/mls-players-association-announces-rebrand|title=MLS Players Association Announces Rebrand}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in April 2003 after the conclusion of ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]''. The founding members of the MLSPA Executive Board included [[Landon Donovan]], [[Tim Howard]], [[Chris Klein (soccer)|Chris Klein]], [[Alexi Lalas]], and [[Ben Olsen]]. Prior to the CBA, players received no form of retirement benefits, and many players lacked basic health insurance.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===2004 CBA===
After negotiating with MLS in 2003 and 2004, on December 1, 2004, the Players Association and MLS signed the first-ever [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) covering MLS players. Among other things, the CBA increased minimum salaries, established a [[401(k)]] plan with guaranteed contributions from MLS, and guaranteed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mlsplayers.org/about-us/history|title=The History of the MLSPA {{!}} MLS Players Association|website=MLS Players Association|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all players and their families will be provided with 100% fully paid health insurance benefits.  In addition, the CBA provides for an independent arbitrator to hear disputes between MLS and the players.  MLS and the Players Association also negotiated a substance abuse policy covering all players in the league, as well as a Group License Agreement.

===2010 Negotiations===
The [[collective bargaining agreement]] ran through the [[2009 Major League Soccer season|2009 season]],  and the labor agreement expired on January 31, 2010.  Progress had been reported in negotiations with the Players Association, with the major issues reportedly player transfer and guaranteed contracts. The Players Association had accused MLS of failing to abide by international regulations set down by governing body FIFA, but the league denied the charge.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} FIFA said they would not intervene in a labor dispute.&lt;ref name="Bleacher Report"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=FIFA won't intervene in MLS labor dispute|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/320347-international-union-says-mls-lockout-possible|accessdate=January 5, 2010|newspaper=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLSPA advised players to report to camp as planned.  Reports had been conflicting about the actual possibility of a work stoppage. Both sides agreed to extend talks to February 12, and then extended then again to February 25, 2010. On March 20, 2010, MLS and MLSPA signed a new 5-year agreement.

The '''Philip F. Anschutz Trophy''' is a silver [[trophy]] that is awarded to winners of [[MLS Cup]]. Since the inaugural MLS Cup in 1996, three trophies have been used: the [[Alan I. Rothenberg]] Trophy from 1996 to 1997, a second version of the Rothenberg Trophy from 1998 to 2007, and the [[Philip F. Anschutz]] Trophy since 2008. The trophy appears in the logo of the tournament, as well as the former "[[scudetto]]" worn by defending champions.

==Earlier trophies==

The first MLS Cup trophy, introduced for the inaugural season in 1996, was named for league founder [[Alan Rothenberg]]. The trophy was phased out after three seasons, with a new trophy also named for Rothenberg introduced in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boehm |first=Charles |date=December 3, 2017 |title=What's the Cup?

==Newer trophy==

On October 29, 2008, Major League Soccer unveiled a redesigned trophy for the MLS Cup, named after [[Philip F. Anschutz]], league co-founder and owner of multiple teams. The new trophy stands {{convert|24|in|cm}} tall above a {{convert|4+5/8|in|cm|adj=on}} base, with two handles that have 11 facets each to represent the 22 players on the field during a match. It weighs {{convert|43|lb|kg}} and is made of [[sterling silver]].&lt;ref name="LATimes-2008"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 7, 2008 |title=MLS trophy snubs league founder Alan Rothenberg |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2008/11/mls-trophy-snub.html |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original trophy is kept by the champions for the offseason before returning to Major League Soccer headquarters in [[New York City]], while a duplicate is awarded to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boehm |first=Charles |date=December 3, 2017 |title=What's the Cup?

The '''Campeones Cup''' is an annual North American [[association football|soccer]] match contested between the champions of the previous [[Major League Soccer]] season and the winner of the [[Campeón de Campeones]] from [[Liga MX]]. The competition was established by the two leagues in 2018.

==Format==
The Campeones Cup is contested by the winner of the [[MLS Cup]], held annually in November, previously in December, to decide the winner of the Major League Soccer season, and the [[Campeón de Campeones]], held annually in July between the winners of the [[Apertura and Clausura]] tournaments in Liga MX. The competition is hosted by the Major League Soccer team, based in either Canada or the United States, at the end of the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=13 March 2018 |title=Major League Soccer and Liga MX Fuel Rivalry with New Partnership |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/03/13/major-league-soccer-and-liga-mx-fuel-rivalry-new-partnership |publisher=[[Major League Soccer]] |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its format is similar to that of the Japanese–South American [[Suruga Bank Championship]], which is always hosted by the Japanese team.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==History==

The competition was announced on 13 March 2018, as part of an inter-league partnership that would also organize youth competitions and a future [[MLS All-Star Game]] featuring an all-star team from Liga MX. The two leagues had previously fielded teams in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], which ran from 2007 to 2010, and currently compete in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]].&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Anne M. |date=13 March 2018 |title=Toronto FC to host first Campeones Cup as MLS, Mexico's Liga MX form partnership |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/tfc/2018/03/13/toronto-fc-to-host-first-campeones-cup-as-mls-mexicos-liga-mx-form-partnership.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inter-league partnership was spurred in part by the [[Canada–Mexico–United States 2026 FIFA World Cup bid|joint North American bid]] for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] and a desire to improve the level of play in [[CONCACAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Tom |date=13 March 2018 |title=Campeones Cup latest venture to unite Liga MX with Major League Soccer |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3417670/campeones-cup-latest-venture-to-unite-liga-mx-with-major-league-soccer |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2018 Campeones Cup|inaugural edition]] was hosted by [[Toronto FC]] at [[BMO Field]] in Toronto on 19 September 2018 and won by [[Tigres UANL]].&lt;ref name="Star"/&gt; [[Atlanta United FC]] became the first MLS team to win, after defeating [[Club América]] 3–2 in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=14 August 2019|title=Warshaw: Atlanta United bring the swagger, take home Campeones Cup |url= https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2019/08/14/warshaw-atlanta-united-bring-swagger-take-home-campeones-cup|publisher=[[Major League Soccer]] |accessdate=27 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Major League Soccer and Liga MX clubs had previously played in the [[North American SuperLiga]], which ran from 2007 to 2010. Both leagues also send clubs to the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], which has been dominated by Mexican clubs, and the [[Campeones Cup]], a single match played between the winners of the [[MLS Cup]] and the [[Campeón de Campeones]].&lt;ref name="ESPN-Marshall"/&gt; The two leagues began planning a bi-national, eight-team competition to complement the Champions League and provide Mexican clubs with matches to replace the [[Copa Libertadores]] in their calendar as soon as 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pérez |first=Salvador |date=May 9, 2017 |title=Gustavo Guzmán confirma torneo binacional entre Liga MX y MLS |language=Spanish |trans-title=Gustavo Guzmán confirms binational tournament between Liga MX and MLS |url=https://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/3130078/gustavo-guzman-confirma-torneo-binacional-entre-liga-mx-y-mls |publisher=ESPN Mexico |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Tom |date=May 9, 2017 |title=Liga MX club owners set to approve cup with MLS this month - Atlas chief |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/mexican-liga-mx/story/3122836/liga-mx-club-owners-set-to-approve-cup-with-mls-this-month-atlas-chief |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLS and Liga MX announced a new partnership in March 2018 to create the Campeones Cup and explore options for other bi-national competitions between their clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Creditor |first=Avi |date=March 13, 2018 |title=MLS, Liga MX Join Forces for Campeones Cup, Future All-Star Game |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/03/13/mls-liga-mx-champions-all-star-game-partnership-campeones-cup |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leagues Cup tournament was announced on May 29, 2019, featuring eight teams in its inaugural edition to be played during the summer.&lt;ref name="Pro"/&gt; The announcement of the tournament was panned by soccer critics in the United States, who called it a meaningless friendly and "cash-grab" for American clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Paul |date=May 29, 2019 |title=Leagues Cup, new MLS-Liga MX venture, immediately panned in media |url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/82467/leagues-cup-new-mls-liga-mx-venture-immediately.html |work=[[Soccer America]] |url-access=subscription |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oshan |first=Jeremiah |date=May 31, 2019 |title=The MLS-Liga MX Leagues Cup is going to suck, and it could have been so much cooler |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2019/5/31/18644828/mls-liga-mx-leagues-cup-criticism |work=[[SB Nation]] |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Paez-Pumar |first=Luis |date=May 29, 2019 |title=Liga MX And MLS Will Compete For A New, Meaningless Trophy |url=https://deadspin.com/liga-mx-and-mls-will-compete-for-a-new-meaningless-tro-1835096896 |work=[[Deadspin]] |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MLS Players Association]] also expressed concerns over the tournament's creation on the basis of schedule congestion during the summertime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=July 23, 2019 |title=Will MLS show it can compete with Liga MX in upcoming Leagues Cup? |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/concacaf-leagues-cup/story/3904611/will-mls-show-it-can-compete-with-liga-mx-in-upcoming-leagues-cup |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=July 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Las Vegas]] was later announced as the host venue for the final and a broadcasting contract for the tournament was awarded to [[ESPN]] and [[TUDN]] (formerly [[Univision Deportes Network]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 11, 2019 |title=Las Vegas to host Liga MX-MLS Leagues Cup final |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/major-league-soccer/story/3898643/las-vegas-to-host-liga-mx-mls-leagues-cup-final |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=July 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cattry |first=Pardeep |date=July 8, 2019 |title=MLS-Liga MX Leagues Cup to broadcast on ESPN, TUDN in United States |url=https://www.prosoccerusa.com/mls/leagues-cup-tv-info-schedule-mls-liga-mx/ |work=ProSoccerUSA |publisher=Tribune Publishing |accessdate=July 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, MLS and Liga MX announced that the second edition of the Leagues Cup in 2020 would feature 16 teams—eight from each league.
