'''Hockey Fights Cancer''' is a charitable initiative of the US and Canadian [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[National Hockey League Players Association]] (NHLPA) dedicated to raising money and awareness toward [[cancer research]]. It was founded in 1998 as an outgrowth of a similar program instituted by the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] after former player [[John Cullen]] made a brief NHL comeback after suffering from [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. The program had raised over [[US$]]14 million according to its Web site in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=101252 NHL Web site, Hockey Fights Cancer, retrieved 14 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
[[Tampa Bay Lightning]] forward [[John Cullen]] was leading his team in scoring late in the [[1996–97 NHL season]] when he was forced out of the lineup after being diagnosed with [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].  He missed the remainder of that season and all of the following season as he suffered from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Kostya |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1014067/index.htm |title=Happy Days |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1998-09-21 |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cullen attempted a comeback in [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]], but chose to retire after four NHL and three minor league games.&lt;ref name="NYT1998"&gt;{{cite web |last=El-Bashir |first=Tarik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/16/sports/hockey-healthy-again-cullen-enjoys-on-ice-retirement.html |title=Healthy again, Cullen enjoys on-ice retirement |work=New York Times |date=1998-12-16 |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recognition of his comeback attempt, the NHL named him the 1999 winner of the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] for dedication and perseverance.&lt;ref name="Masterton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinners.jsp?tro=BMT |title=Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winners |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cullen's  cancer inspired Timm Harmon of the [[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute|Moffitt Cancer Centre]] at the [[University of South Florida]] to partner with the Lightning to raise awareness and money for cancer research.  By December 1998, both the NHL and its union had joined themselves to the cause, creating the Hockey Fights Cancer initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shea |first=Kevin |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ04_10.shtml |title=Stanley Cup journal |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |year=2004 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203212709/http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ04_10.shtml |archivedate=2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hockey Fights Cancer is also supported by the [[National Hockey League Officials Association]], the league's professional trainers' association and media and business partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=25343 |title=Hockey Fights Cancer |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stanley Cup playoffs''' ({{lang-fr|Les séries éliminatoires de la Coupe Stanley}}) is an elimination tournament in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) consisting of four rounds of [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]] to determine the league champion and the winner of the [[Stanley Cup]]. Eight teams from each of the two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals. The final round is commonly known as the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], which matches the two conference champions.

The NHL is the only major professional sports league in North America to refer to its playoffs by the name of its championship trophy, a tradition which has arisen because the Stanley Cup is North America's oldest professional sports trophy, dating back more than two decades before the establishment of the NHL. Originally inscribed the ''Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup'', the trophy was donated in 1892 by [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Preston]], then&amp;ndash;[[Governor General of Canada]], initially as a "[[List of Stanley Cup challenge games|challenge trophy]]" for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. From 1893 when the first Cup was awarded to 1914, the champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and defeated the reigning Cup champion in a final game to claim their win.

Professional teams then first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. Starting in 1915, the Cup was officially competed between the champion of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) and the champion of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA). After a series of league mergers and folds, including the 1917 establishment of the NHL as a successor to the NHA, the Stanley Cup became the championship trophy of the NHL prior to the [[1926–27 NHL season|1926–27 season]].

The NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion. The league's playoff system has changed over the years, from the NHL's inception in 1917, to when the NHL took over the Cup in 1926, to the current setup today.

{{See also|NHL Conference Finals}}

The Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]]. Each series is played in a 2–2–1–1–1 format, meaning the team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while their opponent hosts games three, four, and six. Games five, six, and seven are only played if needed.

Eight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place team in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the [[Wild card (sports)#National_Hockey_League|Wild Cards]]. Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards, it is possible for one division in a conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three.

In the First Round,&lt;ref name="NHL_PlayoffFormat"/&gt; the teams are split into two separate brackets by division. Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards. The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto #4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.

The winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round.&lt;ref name="NHL_PlayoffFormat"/&gt; The reseeding in the previous format, which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed, was discarded. The winners of these series advance to the Conference Finals and the two Conference Final winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals.&lt;ref name="NHL_PlayoffFormat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Playoffs format, qualification system|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=711015|publisher=NHL.com|date=March 24, 2014|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record (regardless of seeding); in the case of a tie, the league's standard [[Season structure of the NHL#Stanley Cup playoffs|tie breaking procedure]] is applied. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while the opponent hosts games three, four, and six (games five through seven are played if necessary).

Any ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols:
#The greater number of ''regulation wins'' only (used since the [[2019–20 NHL season]], reflected by the RW statistic).
#The greater number of ''regulation and overtime wins'', excluding shootouts (used since the [[2010–11 NHL season]], reflected by the ROW statistic).
#The greater number of total wins, including shootouts.
#The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs.  
## If two clubs are tied, and have not played an equal number of home games against each other, the points earned and available in the first game played in the city of the club that had the greater number of home games in games between the two are not included. 
## If more than two clubs are tied, the higher percentage of available points earned in games among those clubs, and not including any "odd" games, are used to determine the standing. The "odd" games are identical to those mentioned in the previous paragraph, that is, the first game in the city of the club that has had more home games in games between each club in the tie. Note that, because of this procedure, if two teams in the multi team tie (also applicable in a two team tie) have only played once against each other, the points earned in that game are not included.
#The greater differential between goals for and goals against during the entire regular season.
#If two clubs are still tied on non-shootout wins, points earned between the tied clubs and regular season goal differential, a [[one-game playoff]] is played under Stanley Cup playoff rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Playoffs format, qualification system|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/philadelphia-flyers-florida-panthers-could-need-play-in-game/c-297737130|publisher=NHL.com|date=April 6, 2018|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overtime rules===
Unlike the regular season where a contest could eventually be decided in a [[Shootout (ice hockey)|shootout]], [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] in the playoffs is played in multiple sudden-death, 20-minute five-on-five periods until one team scores. Although a playoff game could theoretically last indefinitely, only two contests have reached six overtime periods, and both of those did not go beyond six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oh, what a night ... and morning.

==History==
===Origins===
{{main|Stanley Cup#History|List of Stanley Cup challenge games}}

The Stanley Cup was commissioned in 1892 as the ''Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup'' and was named after [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Preston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]] who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=b194502&amp;type=Builder&amp;page=bio&amp;list=ByName|title=Lord Stanley (of Preston)|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Cup was then awarded in 1893 to [[Montreal Hockey Club]].

During the period from 1893 to 1914, the champions held the Cup until they lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated them in a special game or series. The competitive format of each Cup challenge was determined by negotiation between the two clubs. Furthermore, none of the leagues that played for the Cup had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues at the end of the regular season

As the prestige of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players, and thus professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. Then in 1908, the [[Allan Cup]] was introduced as the trophy for Canada's amateurs, and the Stanley Cup became a symbol of professional hockey supremacy. In 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) held its inaugural season and soon emerged as the best professional hockey league in Canada, keeping the Cup for the next four years. In 1914, the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) challenged the NHA and Cup champion [[Toronto Blueshirts]]. One year later, the NHA and the PCHA began an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup, effectively ending the [[List of Stanley Cup challenge games|Cup challenge games]].

After years of the NHA not having an annual playoff tournament to determine its league champion, the [[1916–17 NHA season]] saw the league split its schedule into two halves with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals, which was a [[two-legged tie|two-game total goals series]]. The PCHA continued to award their league title to the team that finished in first place after the regular season.

===Emergence of the NHL===
The [[National Hockey League]] was founded in November 1917 as a successor to the NHA. From the NHL's inception until 1920, both NHL and PCHA teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup. The NHL inherited the NHA's regular season system of dividing it into two halves, with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals. The NHL finals was a [[two-legged tie|two-game total goals series]] in 1918 and a best-of-seven series in 1919. In 1920, the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season. The two halves format was abandoned the next year, and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals series.

At the time, the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and, from 1921, the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion. During this time, as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ (the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six), the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues. Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup, the Cup championship series was a best-of-five series. Following the involvement of the WCHL, one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals (a best-of-three affair starting in 1922), while the other two competed in a best-of-three semifinal. As travel expenses were high during these times, it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete. In a dispute between the leagues in 1923 about whether to send one or both western league champions east, the winner of the PCHA/WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals, while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion, both series being best-of-three.

In 1924 the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams (with the top team getting a bye to the two-game total goal NHL finals), but because the first-place [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]] refused to play under this format, the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals affair. The Stanley Cup Finals returned to a best-of-five format the same year.&lt;ref name=Formats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=25433 |title=Stanley Cup Playoff Formats: 1917 to date |accessdate=June 25, 2013 |publisher=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NHL takes control of Stanley Cup===
With the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in 1925 and the merged league's collapse in 1926, the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup.  While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until 1947, from 1926 onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous. The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions for the 1927–28 season. For 1927, six teams qualified for the playoffs, three from each division, with the division semifinals and finals being a two-game total goals affair, and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best-of-five series. In 1928, the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e. the division winners played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The first place series was a best-of-five affair, with the winner proceeding to the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals, while the others were a two-game total goals series. The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. This format had a slight modification the following year, where the semifinal series became a two-game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-five series. The two-game total goals format was abolished in 1937, with those series being changed to best-of-three affairs.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"&gt;{{cite book |last=McCarthy|first=Dave |year=2008 |title=The National Hockey League Official Guide &amp; Record Book|edition=2009|publisher=Dan Diamond Associates |isbn=978-1-894801-14-0|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Six era===
The 1930s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven, and with it an end to the Canadian and American divisions. The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first- and second-place teams play against each other in a best-of-seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the third- to sixth-place teams battled in a series of best-of-three matches for the other berth (with the third-place team taking on the fourth-place team, and the fifth-place team against the sixth-place team). In 1939, the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-seven series, the format still used today.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

The 1942–43 season saw the removal of the [[New York Americans]], leaving six remaining teams (now known as the "[[Original Six]]"). From 1943 to 1967, all playoff match ups were best-of-seven affairs. The first and third-place teams played in one semifinal, while the second and fourth-place teams played in the other semifinal, with the semifinal winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. During this time, [[Detroit Red Wings]] fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm, as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

===Expansion era===
The 1967 expansion saw the number of teams double from six to 12 in the 1967–68 season, and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions. The playoff format remained largely the same, with all series remaining best-of-seven, and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup. The 1970–71 season, because of fan demand, brought forth the first inter-conference playoff match up outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre-war expansion, which had the winner of the second-place versus fourth-place match up in one conference take on the winner of the first- versus third-place match up in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year had one minor change to its playoff format: a stronger team would face a weaker opponent. Thus, instead of a first-place versus third-place and a second versus fourth-place match up in the first round, the first round had the first-place versus the fourth and the second versus the third-place. This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

The 1974–75 season saw another change to the playoff system to accommodate a league that had expanded to 18 teams in two conferences and four divisions. Under this system, 12 teams qualified for the playoffs. The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal, while the second- and third-place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best-of-three preliminary round. In each round of the playoffs, the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment, with the preliminary-round series being a best-of-three affair while the remainder of the series remained best-of-seven. The 1977–78 season had one minor change in its playoff format: although the second-place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round, the four playoff spots reserved for the third-place teams were replaced by four ''wild-card'' spots—spots for the four teams with the highest regular-season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

===NHL-WHA merger===
With the absorption of four teams from the [[World Hockey Association]] in the 1979–1980 season, a new playoff system was introduced where 16 of the league's 21 teams would qualify for postseason play. The four division winners would qualify for the playoffs while twelve wildcard positions rounded out the sixteen teams. At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals, with the preliminary round being a best-of-five series while all other playoff series were best-of-seven.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

===Divisional playoffs===
The 1981–1982 season brought forth the return of divisional match ups, with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs. Division champions would be determined, followed by the conference champions, who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals. The division semifinals was a best-of-five affair until the 1986–87 season, when it became a best-of-seven series, while all other series remained best-of seven.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

===Conference playoffs===
For the 1993–94 season, the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference-based rather than division-based. Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The division first-place teams were seeded first (the team with the best record in the conference) and second in the conference playoffs and received home ice advantage for the first two rounds. The next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth. All series were best-of-seven, but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams. Instead of the normal 2–2–1–1–1 rotation, a series involving teams from both divisions was 2–3–2, with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road (ALL teams with home-ice advantage chose to play the default 2-2-1-1-1 format, from 1995-1998). After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. The conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

In 1998–99, the league was re-organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece, resulting in the playoff format used through 2013.  The qualifiers remained sixteen, but the seeding changed. The three first-place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs. Of the other teams in each conference, the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seedings.  All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth, by those criteria. After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. Like the 1994–1998 system, the conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals, and home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.&lt;ref name="mccarthy-249"/&gt;

===Return to divisional playoffs===
The NHL realigned into a four-division, two-conference system for the 2013–14 season. Under the new postseason system, the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The format is division-based, similar to the 1981–82 system. In the First Round, the top-ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest-ranked wild-card, while the other division winner plays against the higher ranked wild-card. The second and third place teams in each division then play each other. The first round winners then meet in the Second Round. The third round will still consist of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference Finals, with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.&lt;ref name="2013Realignment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=660138|title=Realignment plan approved by Board of Governors|work=[[NHL.com]]|author=Dan Rosen|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions and trends==
Compared to other major professional sports leagues, playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/sports/hockey/12slapshot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper | work=The New York Times | first1=Jeff Z. | last1=Klein | first2=Stu | last2=Hackel | title=First-Round Upsets Common in N.H.L | date=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NHL broadcaster [[Darren Eliot]], this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven playoff series]].&lt;ref name="SI_Eliot"&gt;{{cite video | title=Inside Report: Presidents' Trophy to curse Caps? | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/video/nhl/2010/04/07/040610.nhl_eliot_presidents_cup.SportsIllustrated/index.html | publisher=SI.com | people=[[Darren Eliot]] | date=April 7, 2010 | accessdate=March 30, 2011 | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team, or other players that pose matchup problems.

And although rare, another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in [[Game seven#Comebacks|game seven comebacks]]. Only four instances has an NHL team been able to come back from being down 0–3 to win a seven-game series: the [[1941-42 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]], the [[1974-75 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]], the [[2009-10 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]], and the [[2013-14 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Los Angeles Kings]]. There has been only one such "reverse sweep" comeback in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|MLB postseason]] (the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 Boston Red Sox]]) and none in the [[NBA playoffs]].

Despite having more American-based teams than Canadian-based ones throughout much of the NHL's existence (dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones, and now 7 to 24 since 2017), there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason: [[1970 Stanley Cup playoffs|1970]] and [[2016 Stanley Cup playoffs|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stubbs|first=Dave|title=Woe Canada.

The Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is based on the ''entire'' NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series, unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada]] (the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]], the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]], and the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP]]), although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals. [[Doug Gilmour]] and [[Peter Forsberg]], in [[1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1986]] and [[1999 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1999]], respectively, are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals.

NHL players have often grown [[playoff beard|beard]]s when their team is in the playoffs, where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the [[New York Islanders]], and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.&lt;ref name="Islanders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/en/news/news.asp?idNews=20877|title=Wooly Bullies|accessdate=May 4, 2007|publisher=The Hockey News|date=May 2, 2006|author=Ryan Kennedy}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SabresFans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/185/story/63880.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118154258/http://www.buffalonews.com/185/story/63880.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 18, 2013|title=One team, one goal, no razors|accessdate=May 4, 2007|publisher=The Buffalo News|date=April 28, 2007|author=Barbara Sullivan}} &lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of a playoff series, players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team, and this has been described by commentators as "one of the great traditions in sports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Analyst |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/178083-nhl-playoff-tradtions-why-the-nhl-is-the-most-celebrated-league |title=NHL Playoff Traditions: Why the NHL Is the Most Celebrated League |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate, such as [[Gerry Cheevers]] who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dropyourgloves.com/Games/GameEvents.aspx?Game=14746 DropYourGloves.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]] who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses.&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2009/03/sean_avery_gets_best_of_new_je.html|title = Sean Avery gets best of New Jersey Devils in New York Rangers' 3-0 victory|last = Stephenson|first = Colin|date = March 30, 2009|work = [[The Star-Ledger]]|access-date = May 7, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the 1996 playoffs when several [[Detroit Red Wings]] players protested the dirty hit by the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Claude Lemieux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2007/columns/story?columnist=frei_terry&amp;id=2850149 |title=Yes, it's tradition, but players should have a choice - NHL - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2008 playoffs when [[Martin Brodeur]] refused to shake [[Sean Avery]]'s hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

It is common among players to never touch or hoist the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] ([[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion) or [[Clarence S. Campbell Bowl]] ([[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion) after they have won the [[NHL Conference Finals|conference finals]]; the players feel that the [[Stanley Cup]] is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. There have been six recent exceptions to this – [[Scott Stevens]] of the Devils in 2000 and 2003; [[Sidney Crosby]] of the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017; and [[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the Capitals in 2018. In five of these occurrences, their teams went on to win the Stanley Cup. In recent years, the captain of the winning team poses (usually looking solemn) with the conference trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NHL.com – Ice Age: Having another trophy in mind | url=http://www.nhl.com/features/iceage/main060206.html | first=Phil | last=Coffey | date=June 2, 2006|accessdate=July 25, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many [[Traditions and anecdotes associated with the Stanley Cup|traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy]], the [[Stanley Cup]].

Because the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Team Canada 1972: The Official 40th Anniversary Celebration of the Summit Series | first=Andrew | last=Podnieks | publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart | date=Sep 4, 2012| quote=Thus, the only professionals who could participate were those on NHL teams that did not make the playoffs or were eliminated quickly}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been in place since a 1977 agreement between the NHL and the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], which allowed [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] to field a team in the World Championships after an-eight year absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Law of Hockey | first=John | last=Barnes | publisher=Butterworths &amp; Company | date=2010 | page=83 | quote=Since 1977, Canada has competed at the annual IIHF competition mainly using players from teams that have been eliminated from the NHL play-offs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Duplacey | first=James | title=Total Hockey: The official encyclopedia of the National Hockey League | year=1998 | publisher=Total Sports | isbn=0-8362-7114-9 | pages=506 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/totalhockeyoffic0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guardian Media Entertainment''', LLC is media joint venture of the [[POW! Entertainment|SLG Entertainment]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] Enterprises and [[NBCUniversal]].

==History==
In October 2010, Guardian Media Entertainment, was formed by [[POW! Entertainment|SLG Entertainment]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] Enterprises, created [[hockey]]-themed superheroes called "Guardians" for each of the 30 teams in the National Hockey League. The venture includes a [[graphic novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardianproject30.com/ |title=The Guardian Project |publisher=Guardian Media Entertainment |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60TZcx1uY?url=http://www.guardianproject30.com/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Wayne |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=152537 |title=NHL's 'Guardian Project' Strikes Marketing Deal With NBCU |work=Media Daily News |date=June 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62l12sVyR?url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/152537/ |archivedate=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardians were first introduced at the 2011 NHL All-Star Game.  Guardian Media reached an venture agreement with NBCUniversal in June for further media projects from movies to television series and promotion for an equity in the company.  In September, Guardian Media, SLG Entertainment, [[Anthony Chargin]], and [[J. David Shapiro|Jake Shapiro]] were sued by [[Adam Asherson]] who claimed Chargin, Shapiro and Asherson original created this project under the name "Defenders" for the [[National Football League]] in 2003 to include Stan Lee but fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|title=Stan Lee's Sports Superhero Project Targeted In Lawsuit|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/stan-lees-sports-superhero-project-242075|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Hockey League rules''' are the rules governing the play of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), a professional [[ice hockey]] organization. Infractions of the rules, such as [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games. 

The rules are one of the two standard sets of [[ice hockey]] rules in the world. The rules themselves have evolved directly from the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor ice hockey game]] in [[Montreal]] in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the league adopted the existing [[National Hockey Association]] set of rules. While designed to govern play of games organized by the league, the NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing most ice hockey leagues in [[North America]].

The rules differ slightly from the rules used in international games organized by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) such as the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] (the NHL rules, however, are used in the [[World Cup of Hockey]]). The IIHF rules are themselves also based on Canadian rules of ice hockey dating back to the early 20th Century.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}} The NHL and IIHF differ in the treatment of fighting and in playing rules, such as icing, the areas of play for goaltenders, helmet rules, officiating rules, timeouts and play reviews.

==Hockey rink==

Near each end of the rink there is a red ''goal line'' spanning the width of the ice. It is used to judge [[Goal (hockey)|goal]]s and icing calls.

New since the [[2005–06 NHL season]], after testing in the [[American Hockey League]], a [[trapezoid]] is marked behind each goalie net. The goalie can only play the puck within that area or in front of the goal line. If he plays the puck behind the goal line and not in the trapezoid, a 2-minute minor penalty for delay of game will be assessed by the referees. This rule is widely referred to as the "[[Martin Brodeur#The Brodeur Rule|Brodeur rule]]", after [[New Jersey Devils]] goalie [[Martin Brodeur]], whose puckhandling behind the net is believed to be the cause for the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Diamos, Jason|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616F835550C758DDDA00894DD404482|title=New Rule Will Take a Weapon Away from Brodeur|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2007}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jones, Tom|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/18/Sports/Brodeur_not_handling_.shtml|title=Brodeur not handling new rule well|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 18, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the NHL lengthened the goal-line side of the trapezoid by two feet on both sides of the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=730165&amp;navid=nhl:topheads|title=NHL announces rules changes for 2014-15 season}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game timing==
In the [[National Hockey League]], between stoppages of play, teams have 18 seconds (five seconds for the visiting team, eight seconds for the home team, five seconds to line up at the faceoff location) to substitute their players, except during [[Television timeout|TV timeouts]]. TV timeouts are two minutes long, and occur three times per period, during normal game stoppages after the 6, 10, and 14 minute marks of the period, unless there is a power play, a goal that has just been scored, or the stoppage was as a result of an icing. Each team may also take one 30 second time-out, but it may only be taken during a normal stoppage of play. Each period, teams rotate nets, therefore changing attacking directions.

==Scoring==
A goal is scored when the  puck passes entirely across the red line painted between the goal posts and below the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26489 "NHL Official Rule 78.4"]. [[National Hockey League]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A goal may be disallowed under the following circumstances:

# The scoring team takes a penalty (except if the other team puts the puck into its own net untouched by the team to be penalized)
# The puck is directed in by an attacker's high stick (above the crossbar)
# The puck has been directed, batted, thrown or kicked into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick (angling one's skate so the puck deflects off it into the goal is allowed)
# Goaltender interference (which can also result in a penalty)
# The puck goes in after a referee intends to stop play (e.g. the net has been dislodged)
# The puck deflects off a referee or linesman and goes directly into the goal (exception to the rule that a puck hitting a referee or a linesman is still live)
# A goal was allowed at the other end (this can happen if a video review clarifies a goal scored prior, as happened in a game on November 15, 2010 between the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks)
# If a linesman reports to the referee (a) a double-minor for high-sticking, (b) a major penalty, or (c) a match penalty against the scoring team.

When a regular-season game is tied at the end of regulation, it goes into a three-on-three, five-minute overtime period after a one-minute rest period with teams reversing the attacking direction. If a goal is scored during this period, the game ends and the team that scored the goal wins the game. If there is no scoring in the five-minute overtime, the game goes into a three-round shootout with the home team given the choice of shooting or defending first. This sequence ends when one team mathematically has more shootout goals than the other, thus winning the game. If neither team emerges victorious, the shootout continues one frame at a time until one team scores and the other does not, in which case the team that scores is given the win. A team that loses a game in overtime or the shootout receives one point in the standings; the awarding of game points to losing teams is a point of debate among fans and the media.

==Offside==
{{Main|Offside (ice hockey)}}
In ice hockey, play is said to be ''offside'' if a player on the attacking team crosses the offensive blue line and into the [[Hockey rink#Zones|offensive zone]] before the [[Hockey puck|puck]] (unless the defensive team brings the puck into their own zone). A violation occurs when an offside player touches the puck. If a player crosses the line ahead of the puck but his team is not in possession of it, the linesman will raise his arm to signal a delayed offside; when all players from the offside team leave their offensive zone ("tag up" in the neutral zone) the linesman washes out the delayed call. When an offside violation occurs, the [[Linesman (ice hockey)|linesman]] blows the play dead, and a [[faceoff]] is conducted in the [[Hockey rink#Zones|neutral zone]]. During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004-05 lockout]], the league removed the "two-line offside pass" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the [[Hockey rink#Lines|center line]], unless the puck crossed the line before the player. The removal of the two-line offside was one of several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring, which had been in decline since the early 1990s. The only time a player may precede the puck into the attacking zone with the puck behind in the neutral zone is if none of his teammates are in the attacking zone and the player with the puck has control of the puck in the estimation of the linesman (e.g. short-sticking/spin-o-rama).

==Icing==
{{Main|Icing (ice hockey)}}

Icing occurs when a player shoots the [[Hockey puck|puck]] across both the [[Red line (hockey)|center line]] and the opposing team's goal line without the puck going through the goal crease. When icing occurs, a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two faceoff dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. If the attacking player beats the defender for the puck, the icing is waved off. Play is resumed with a [[faceoff]] in the defending zone of the team that committed the infraction. Icing is not enforced for a team that is short-handed. If the goaltender makes a move from his net to play the puck, the icing is immediately waved off (in contrast to minor league and international hockey, where the goaltender must play the puck for it to be waved off). Icing can also be waved off if, in the officials' opinion, the defending team had a viable opportunity to play the puck before crossing the goal line. After an icing, a TV timeout cannot be called. Some teams may fashion "dumping in" the puck, which is shooting the puck into the opposing team's zone, then chasing it. This must be done after the puck crosses the center line or the play will be icing.

Following the 2004–2005 lockout, the icing rule insists that the team in violation of icing the puck is not allowed to make any line changes before the following [[faceoff]].

==Face-offs==
{{main|Face-off#Ice hockey}}
{{see also|Home advantage#Factors related to the game rules}}

Face-offs are used to start play at the beginning of each period and after all stoppages of play. At all levels of play, the teams line up in opposition to one another, and one player from each team (normally the centre) face each other at a designated point on the ice. Once a game official drops the puck between the two opposing skaters' sticks, they attempt to gain control of it.

The face-off procedure differs slightly between NHL and international rules. Prior to the 2015–16 NHL season, the away team's centre was required to place his stick on the ice first. Since that season, this is true only for face-offs on the centre-line dot; for face-offs in either attacking zone, the defending centre must place his stick first. Under international rules, the attacking centre must place his stick first for all face-offs.

==Eligibility==
The Trushinski [[bylaw]] says players who are blind in one or both eyes are ineligible to play. The rule is named for [[Frank Trushinski]], a minor league hockey player for the [[Kitchener Greenshirts]]. Trushinski lost his sight in one eye in a game in 1921, but was allowed to continue playing. In a later game, he suffered a [[skull fracture]] which cost him most of the sight in his other eye.

==Helmets==
In August 1979, [[John Ziegler Jr.]], the president of the National Hockey League, announced that [[Hockey helmet|protective helmets]] would become mandatory in the NHL. "The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor", he said. The only exception to the rule are players—after signing a waiver form—who signed pro contracts prior to June 1, 1979. Essentially, this [[grandfather clause]] allowed hockey's veterans to choose whether or not they wanted to wear helmets but forced all new players to wear them.

==Penalties==
{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}
A penalty is a [[punishment]] for infractions of the rules. A [[Official (ice hockey)#Referees|referee]] makes most penalty calls while the [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesmen]] may call only obvious technical infractions such as ''too many men on the ice''. In the NHL, the linesmen may also stop play due to player injury, and may report to the referees during any stoppage in play, any circumstances pertaining to major, match, or misconduct penalties, abuse of officials (physical or otherwise), unsportsmanlike conduct, or double-minor penalties for [[high-sticking]] causing injury, that were not detected by the referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL Official Rule 32.4|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26320|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a penalty, the player who committed the infraction is sent to the [[penalty box]]. Small infractions are deemed minor penalties, and the player is kept off the ice for two minutes of gameplay. A larger infraction such as high-sticking that causes the victimized player to have a visible physical injury is deemed a double-minor, and the perpetrator is kept off the ice for four minutes. More dangerous infractions, such as fighting, are deemed major penalties and have a duration of five minutes. The penalized team cannot replace the player on the ice and is thus [[Shorthanded (hockey)|shorthanded]] for the duration of the penalty. Normally, hockey teams have five skaters (plus the [[goaltender]]) on the ice. If a minor or major penalty is called, play becomes "five-on-four"—five skaters versus four skaters.

This situation is called a [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] for the non-penalized team and a penalty kill for the penalized team. A team is far more likely to score on a power play than during normal play. If the penalized team is scored on during a minor penalty, the penalty immediately terminates. A double-minor is divided into two separate two-minute minor penalties that are served consecutively. This means that if a goal is scored by the team on the power play before the first minor is over (before the two-minute mark of the power play), the first minor ends and the penalty clock goes down to two minutes.  If a goal is scored during the second minor (after the two-minute mark of the power play), the penalty ends. Unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play. When a penalty is about to be called, an official will raise his arm to signal what is referred to as a "delayed penalty". Play will continue until the offending team touches the puck, at which point, the official will blow the play dead and assess the penalty. If a delayed penalty is called and goes to the end of the period then the full penalty goes to the next period. If the team committing a penalty yields a goal and is already shorthanded because of a minor penalty, the penalty will be called when the goal is scored, and the team scoring a goal will be awarded a fresh power play. Furthermore, when goals are scored, penalties come off the board in the order in which they were called (if multiple penalties have been called). If a goaltender takes a penalty (etc. delay of game), a player who was on the ice at the time of the penalty goes to the penalty box, and the goalie stays in game. If a goaltender takes a game misconduct penalty, the goaltender is pulled from the game, and a backup is put in.

The offending team cannot touch the puck during a delayed penalty. This usually results in the opposing team replacing their goalie with an extra forward until the offending team touches the puck, since the offending team must touch the puck in order to score on the empty net. This situation, however, can result in an [[own goal]]. For example:

* In the November 24, 2008 [[New York Islanders]]–[[Montreal Canadiens]] game, when the referee was about to call a penalty against New York, [[Montreal Canadiens]]' goaltender [[Carey Price]] headed back to the bench for an extra forward. At that moment, Canadiens' defenceman [[Ryan O'Byrne]], not noticing the delayed penalty and the empty net, attempted to pass the puck to his (now-missing) goaltender. Instead, the puck landed in the net and a goal was awarded to the Islanders' [[Bill Guerin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News |author=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BtwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S_AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5618%2C763662 |title=Islanders 4, Canadiens 3 |page=3B |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the March 21, 2009 game between the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]], Phoenix scored an empty-net goal during a delayed penalty against the Coyotes' [[Viktor Tikhonov (ice hockey, born 1988)|Viktor Tikhonov]]. In an attempt to take possession and thus stop play, Tikhonov poke-checked Vancouver's [[Henrik Sedin]] near the Vancouver blue line. Since Tikhonov only ever touched Sedin's stick, and not the puck, play continued, even though the puck was now headed straight for Vancouver's goal. Sedin's teammate [[Shane O'Brien (ice hockey)|Shane O'Brien]] skated after the errant puck, but to no avail. Both the puck and O'Brien landed in the net, and Tikhonov was credited with the goal.
* In the March 21, 2013, game between the [[New Jersey Devils]] and the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], when the referee was about to call a 2:00 minor penalty against the Devils' [[Marek Židlický|Marek Zidlicky]] for hooking, Carolina goaltender [[Dan Ellis]] was about to head to the bench for an extra attacker when he discovered [[Jordan Staal]]'s pass to [[Tim Gleason]] was unsuccessful and, as a result, made the puck bounce off the boards and into the empty net. Ellis tried to chase after it, but he was too slow, and, because Carolina's [[Alexander Semin]] was already in the penalty box at that time, a power play goal was awarded to the Devils; its goaltender, [[Martin Brodeur]]—the last Devil to touch the puck—was credited with the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=uTUAYI75ssY|title=Martin Brodeur Credited with a Goal 3/21/13 Devils @ Hurricanes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the rule where a team cannot replace a player on the ice after a penalty: mutual majors for fighting, where there are two participants in a fight, will result in each person receiving five minutes, but the penalties will not affect the on-ice strength of either team (play remains five-on-five), unless a player is deemed to be the instigator of the fight, in which case that player will receive an additional two-minute minor. There are also "coincidental" minors in which the penalties called against both teams are simultaneous and equal in length, so that neither team receives a power play, with teams skating four-on-four.

After the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], a new rule was instituted that imposes a minor [[Delay of game (ice hockey)|delay-of-game]] penalty on any defensive player who directs the puck out of bounds (e.g., over the glass into the stands or into the safety netting). When the puck is shot into either of the players’ benches, the penalty will not apply.

There are also game- and 10-minute-misconduct penalties which are reserved for infractions such as continued disputing of a call with an official or for intent-to-injure penalties. A player receiving a misconduct penalty does not cause his team to play short-handed unless he also receives a minor, major, or match penalty in addition to the misconduct penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26305|title=NHL Official Rule 22.3|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various combinations of penalties may also result in match-ups such as 5-on-3, 4-on-3, 4-on-4 or even 3-on-3. A team, however, may not have fewer than four players (including the goaltender) on the ice at any point in the game.

After a penalty is assessed, play resumes with a face-off in the offending team's defensive zone under most circumstances.

If a penalty is called on a team in overtime, the game cannot become 3-on-2, as there cannot be less than three skaters on the ice for a team. Instead, the power play team gets a four-on-three power play.

If a penalty is called with less than two minutes to go in a period, except for overtime, a penalty is "carried over" into the next period, meaning that any power plays called in the final two minutes of a period move along to the next period, meaning that if a penalty is called at 19:01 in the first period, then 1:01 minutes of the power play will go to the second period.

In a four-on-four or three-on-three penalty combination, icing will still be enforced.

==Team roster==
The maximum number of players on an NHL roster is 23. A team can have a maximum of 50 signed players and a total of 90 players (unsigned and signed).

==Potential rule changes==
In August 2010, the NHL held an "[[Research and development|R &amp; D]] camp" at the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]’ [[MasterCard Centre|practice facility]], where rule changes under consideration were given trial runs. [[Exhibition game|Scrimmages]] at the camp, featuring some top players eligible for the [[2011 NHL Entry Draft]], experimented with changes such as two-on-two [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]], shallower goal nets, a [[Official (ice hockey)|referee]] viewing the play from an elevated off-ice platform, and a rink with three [[face-off]] circles instead of the traditional five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/09/16/ice-capades/print/ |title=The NHL’s ice-capades |date=September 16, 2010 |first=Colby |last=Cosh |work=[[Maclean’s]] |accessdate=September 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919002220/http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/09/16/ice-capades/print/ |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12466">'''Compliance buyouts''' (sometimes referred to as '''amnesty buyouts''') allow [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) teams to buy-out a player's contract by paying him two-thirds of the remaining value of a contract over twice the remaining length of the contract. If the player is under 26 years old, then the team may pay the player just one-third of the remaining contract value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/nhl-s-compliance-buyouts-are-similar-to-nba-s-amnesty-concept-1.5637855|title=NHL's compliance buyout explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ordinary-course buyouts, the team's [[NHL salary cap]] hit for the player is stretched over a period of twice the remaining length of the contract. Compliance buyouts follow the same formula as ordinary-course buyouts but do not count against the cap.

Due to the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]], the salary cap was not to increase to the projected $70.2 million, so each team was therefore granted two compliance buyouts to be exercised after the [[2012-13 NHL season|2012–13 season]] and/or after the [[2013–14 NHL season|2013–14 season]] that would not count against the salary cap in any further year in order to better comply with a lower than expected cap value, regardless of the player's age. After using an compliance buyout on a player, that player is prohibited from rejoining the team that bought him out for one year; the NHL deemed that the re-signing of a player following a trade and a subsequent compliance buyout would be ruled as cap circumvention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/nhl_trips_up_buyouts_90sX16wV28TR1GtnCDS8ZO | work=New York Post | first=Larry | last=Brooks | title=NHL trips up buyouts | date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]] each team was granted one accelerated compliance buyout in order for teams to meet the lowered salary cap. This could be used on a player with a salary cap hit of US$3 million or more before the regular season began. If an accelerated compliance buyout is used, that team will only have one more compliance buyout left, and they must use it after the completion of the 2012–13 season (and before the start of 2013–14 season). The player's cap hit is applied in full to the team's salary cap for the 2012–13 season, but for no season after, regardless of contract length.

Available during the off-season in 2013 and 2014, amnesty buyouts begin 48 hours after the conclusion of the [[Stanley Cup Finals]].

In 2013, it began 48 hours after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup, and ended on July 4, 2013. The second NHL compliance buyout period opened on June 16, 2014, and ran through June 30, 2014, with 26 teams having one or more compliance buyout available to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2014/06/15/nhl-compliance-buyouts-preview/10553419/ | work=USA Today | title=Compliance buyout period opens on Monday | date=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHL.com. October 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Each NHL Franchise is represented by one of the 30 heroes, titled "Guardians". They are all named in accordance with the name of the team (e.g. The Flame for the [[Calgary Flames]]).

==Plot==
Mike Mason is a 15-year-old hockey fan, who sketched 30 different characters for the NHL teams, designing their powers and personalities, giving them alter-egos and writing about grand adventures they would embark on. Once the evil Devin Dark and his military machines attack Earth, Mason's characters came to life as the Guardians.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/The-NHL-Guardian-Project-origin-story-Behind-th?urn=nhl-310128]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The Guardian characters were revealed sequentially according to a bracket pairing Guardians and encouraging fans to vote via [[Facebook]] on which character they would like to see first. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The superheroes were revealed every day from January 1, 2011, until January 30, in time for the [[58th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2011 NHL All-Star Game]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=524456 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116202018/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=524456 |archivedate=2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By June, [[NBCUniversal]] had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with GME, hoping to exploit the Guardian franchise in various media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/06/nbcuniversal-getting-into-superhero-biz-.html]&lt;/ref&gt; But by December 2011, the project had failed to develop momentum&lt;ref&gt;[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/stan-lee-nhl-guardian-project-failure-cost-tech-151350817.html Stan Lee’s NHL Guardian Project failure cost tech firm millions - Yahoo!

'''''Kraft Hockeyville''''' is an annual competition sponsored by [[Kraft Heinz]], the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[NHL Players' Association]] in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of [[ice hockey]]. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL pre-season game. Runners-up also get smaller cash prizes to upgrade their ice rinks. The contest is normally held in the winter and spring during the latter half of the NHL regular season, with the pre-season game usually held in September before the following regular season. If the winning arena is not adequately equipped to host the pre-season game, it is then played at an alternative site nearby.

The idea and theme was developed by Capital C, a Canadian Advertising Agency that was founded by Tony Chapman. The contest itself was developed by Fred Nicolaidis, Pamela McNair, and Harry Doupe of the CBC. The competition was first held across Canada in 2006 as a [[reality television]] series aired by [[CBC Television]], but since 2007, it has been relegated to segments aired during CBC's ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.   Kraft expanded the event in 2015 to the United States, with segments of the US contest are aired on the ''[[NHL on NBC]]''.

The Kraft Hockeyville games are televised regionally, in their respective countries on national basis.  From 2006 to 2014, the Canadian game was broadcast across Canada on CBC, while [[Sportsnet]] took over airing it in 2015. The United States game is televised nationally in the U.S. on [[NBCSN]].

==Rules==
Communities are invited to submit their nominations. The application form also requires a short essay, and photographs or a video, depicting the community's hometown pride and passion for the game of hockey. A judging panel then selects four finalists. The winner is then determined by a public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kraft.promo.eprize.com/hockeyville2018/public/share/fulfillment/rules_ca.pdf | title=Karft Hockeyville Canada rules | accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kraft.promo.eprize.com/hockeyville2018/public/share/fulfillment/rules.pdf | title=Karft Hockeyville USA rules | accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2006 season===
The inaugural 2006 season of ''Hockeyville'' featured finalists Smithers, British Columbia, Falher and Airdrie, Alberta, Barry's Bay, Ontario, and as its very first champion, the community of [[Salmon River, Colchester County (community)|Salmon River]], [[Nova Scotia]].  Salmon River's entry, the "Deuvilles Rink", beat 450 other entries from across Canada. The initial four episodes for the 2006 season were shot at the Memorial Centre in Kingston, Ontario, with the final three episodes shot in [[Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena &amp; Skating Centre]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

The NHL exhibition game was held September 25 at the [[Colchester Legion Stadium]] in the neighbouring town of [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] (the Deuville Rink being too small); the [[Montreal Canadiens]] beat the [[Ottawa Senators]] 7-3.

*The Deuville rink was awarded the C$50,000 Home Depot gift card prize and with the cards the roof was reshingled, new rink lights were installed, ceiling insulated and a heated section was installed at the end of the arena.

===2007 season===
The 2007 season of ''Hockeyville'' began on March 4 and was changed significantly from the previous season's format. Organizers made the application process more accessible. Communities could now enter by logging on to the website, creating a team name, filling out an application form, submitting a short essay and including three photographs which depict hometown pride and passion for the game of hockey. A video, which was a requirement in previous contests, is no longer part of the process.

In 2007 the series was no longer given its own time slot, but rather shown during broadcasts of [[Hockey Night in Canada]].

The Top 10 communities resulting from the first round were [[Cornwall, Ontario]]; [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]]; [[Noëlville, Ontario]]; [[North Bay, Ontario]]; [[Plaster Rock, New Brunswick]]; [[Rockyford, Alberta]]; [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec]]; [[Smithers, British Columbia]]; [[Vernon, British Columbia]] and [[Warner, Alberta]].

The Top 5 communities resulting from the second round were Cornwall, Noëlville, North Bay, Smithers and Warner.

North Bay was the winner. The [[Atlanta Thrashers]] beat the [[New York Islanders]] 4-3 in overtime.

===2008 season===
The 2008 season of ''Kraft Hockeyville'' began February 23.

The top 10 communities that were in the running for Kraft Hockeyville 2008 were:
* '''East''': [[Channel – Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador]] vs. [[Rothesay, New Brunswick]]
* '''West''': [[Wilcox, Saskatchewan]] vs. [[Redwater, Alberta]]
* '''Quebec''': [[Rouyn-Noranda]] vs. Village sur Glace de [[Roberval, Quebec|Roberval]]
* '''Ontario''': [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]] vs. [[Kingsville, Ontario|Kingsville]]
* '''Wildcard''': [[Winnipegosis, Manitoba]] vs. [[Pilot Mound, Manitoba]]

The top 5 communities were:
*'''Week 1:''' Village sur Glace de [[Roberval, Quebec|Roberval]] (Quebec Region)
*'''Week 2:''' [[Channel – Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador]] (Atlantic Region)
*'''Week 3:''' [[Kingsville, Ontario]] (Ontario Region)
*'''Week 4:''' [[Wilcox, Saskatchewan]] (Western Region)
*'''Week 5:''' [[Pilot Mound, Manitoba]] (Wildcard)

On April 8, 2008, Roberval won the title of Kraft Hockeyville 2008. Roberval won:
* C$100,000 towards upgrades to the Roberval Arena
* An NHL pre-season game at the Roberval Arena on Tuesday, September 23, 2008 in which the [[Montreal Canadiens]] defeated the [[Buffalo Sabres]] 3-2.
* A ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' broadcast from Roberval

The pre-season game has been taped and shown on a ''Hockeyville'' special Saturday, September 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2008/09/c3802.html CNW Group | NEWS - MEDIA | Roberval, Quebec wins KRAFT HOCKEYVILLE 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4 remaining communities from the Top 5 won:
* C$20,000 to be used for upgrades to the Home Arena that the community endorses
* A ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' broadcast from each of the remaining top five communities

===2009 season===
The 2009 edition had these cities as the five regional finalists:
*'''Atlantic:''' [[Harbour Grace, Newfoundland and Labrador]]
*'''Quebec:''' [[Thetford Mines|Thetford Mines, Quebec]]
*'''Ontario:''' [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich Township, Ontario]]
*'''Western:''' [[Terrace, British Columbia]]
*'''Wildcard:''' [[Humboldt, Saskatchewan]]

The winner, announced on March 7 during the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] broadcast, was Terrace, British Columbia. Terrace played host to the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and the [[New York Islanders]] on Monday, September 14, in which the Canucks defeated the Islanders by a score of 2-1. The game was broadcast live on [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] in the US, and highlights were televised during a one-hour Kraft Hockeyville broadcast showcasing their community on CBC Television. Terrace also received C$100,000 towards arena upgrades from Kraft Canada.

===2010 season===
The five finalists for the 2010 edition of ''Hockeyville''
*'''Atlantic:''' [[Bishop's Falls, Newfoundland and Labrador]]
*'''Quebec:''' [[Stanstead, Quebec]]
*'''Ontario:''' [[Dundas, Ontario]]
*'''Western:''' [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]]
*'''Wildcard:''' [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia]]

Dundas, Ontario was announced as the winner by [[Gary Bettman]] on April 3, 2010, during the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] broadcast with 1,066,855 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thespec.com/News/article/747618|title=Dundas: Canada's Hockeyville|date=2010-04-04|publisher=TheSpec.com|accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game featured division rivals [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Ottawa Senators]] playing in Dundas's [[J. L. Grightmire Arena]] on September 28, 2010, with Buffalo winning 2-1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=538905&lt;/ref&gt; (Incidentally, Dundas has been, since 2000, within the boundaries of the city of [[Hamilton, Ontario]], a frequent target of efforts regarding [[potential National Hockey League expansion]].)

===2011 season===
In 2011, the wildcard was eliminated and the West and Pacific divisions were split from each other.

The top 5 communities were:
* '''Pacific''': [[Mackenzie, British Columbia]]
* '''West''': [[Bentley, Alberta]]
* '''Ontario''': [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]]
* '''Quebec''': [[Saint-Raymond, Quebec|Saint-Raymond]]
* '''Atlantic''': [[Conception Bay South]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]

Conception Bay South, NL, was declared the winner of Kraft Hockeyville 2011 on April 2, 2011. The town's arena received C$100,000 worth of renovations, and also was to host a pre-season game between the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] on September 26, 2011. However, with the purchase of the Thrashers and their re-location to Winnipeg as a revival of the [[Winnipeg Jets]], the game was instead played between the Senators and Jets. Additionally, the game was re-located to the [[Mile One Centre]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], 30&amp;nbsp;km north of Conception Bay South, which was the home arena of their newly relocated [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[St. John's IceCaps]] (formerly the [[Manitoba Moose]]). The Jets defeated the Senators, 3–1.&lt;ref name=gm89&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/globe-on-hockey/nhl-set-to-play-preseason-games-all-over-world/article2124179/ |title = NHL set to play preseason games all over world |work = The Globe and Mail |location = Toronto  |access-date =  August 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the other 4 finalists received C$25,000 in arena upgrades from Kraft.

===2012 season (Game played in 2013 season)===
[[Stirling-Rawdon]], [[Ontario]] was the winner of the 2012 Kraft Hockeyville contest. The planned game between the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] on October 3&lt;ref name="NHL.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=625275 | title=Stirling-Rawdon crowned Kraft Hockeyville | publisher=National Hockey League | date=March 31, 2012 | accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leafs announce 2012-13 schedule"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/21/leafs-announced-2012-13-schedule | title=Leafs announce 2012-13 schedule | work=Toronto Sun | date=June 21, 2012 | accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was eventually cancelled due to the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]], but other festivities continued as scheduled. An NHL alumni charity game was held in the town instead, with one of the participants being Stirling native [[Rob Ray]].  No contest was held in 2013 due to the lockout.&lt;ref&gt;https://edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Kraft+cancels+Hockeyville+program+lockout/7583826/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; A makeup game for the market was held in [[Belleville, Ontario]] on 2013 between the [[Washington Capitals]] and the [[Winnipeg Jets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/capitals-watch/2013/jun/27/capitals-face-blackhawks-bruins-twice-each-preseas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 season===
The Top 16 towns for the Kraft Hockeyville contest were announced on Saturday, March 8. This year's contest has a theme much like the NHL itself: East VS West. This means there are 8 towns chosen from Eastern Canada and 8 towns from Western Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/hockeyville-top-16-communites-announced-1.2565151&lt;/ref&gt;

From Eastern Canada:
* '''Richmond, ON'''
* '''Prescott, ON'''
* '''Beeton, ON'''
* '''Exeter, ON'''
* '''Chicoutimi, QC'''
* '''Kingston, NS'''
* '''Amherst, NS'''
* '''Central Bedeque, PEI'''
From Western Canada:
* '''Salmon Arm, BC'''
* '''Kimberly, BC'''
* '''Osoyoos, BC'''
* '''Bruderheim, AB'''
* '''St. Albert, AB'''
* '''Sylvan Lake, AB'''
* '''Swift Current, SK'''
* '''Arborg, MB'''
This year, the top 16 towns are guaranteed C$25,000 in upgrades to their arenas instead of the top 5. Then the top 4 (two from the East and two from the West) received at least C$50,000. The winner receives the usual prize of C$100,000, an NHL pre-season game hosted in their community, and a visit from CBC's ''Hockey Night in Canada''. Voting for the top 16 ended on Monday, March 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://krafthockeyville.cbc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvan Lake won the competition on April 7, and hosted a pre-season game between the [[Arizona Coyotes]] and the [[Calgary Flames]] on September 24.

===2015 season===
For the 2015 season, ''Kraft Hockeyville USA'', for the first time, drew candidates from the [[United States]]. The US finalist in the east was the [[Cambria County War Memorial Arena]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], while the finalist in the west was the Decatur Civic Center in [[Decatur, Illinois]]. Johnstown was named the winner on May 2, received US$150,000 for arena upgrades, and hosted the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=766175 | title=Johnstown, PA wins title of first-ever 'Kraft Hockeyville USA' | publisher=National Hockey League | date=May 2, 2015 | accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was televised in the United States on [[NBCSN]].

The Canadian Kraft Hockeyville finalist in the east was the [[Chatham Memorial Arena]] in [[Chatham, Ontario]], and the finalist in the west was the Panorama Recreation Center Hockey Arena in [[North Saanich, British Columbia]]. North Saanich was named the winner on April 5, and received C$100,000 in upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=761490 | title=North Saanich, B.C. named Kraft Hockeyville 2015 | publisher=National Hockey League | date=April 5, 2015 | accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Panorama Recreation Center Hockey Arena had a limited capacity of only 500, the pre-season game featuring the [[San Jose Sharks]] and the [[Vancouver Canucks]] was instead played at [[The Q Centre]] in nearby [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.timescolonist.com/sports/north-saanich-s-kraft-hockeyville-game-headed-to-the-q-centre-1.1980990 | title=North Saanich's Kraft Hockeyville game headed to The Q Centre | work=Times Colonist | date=June 25, 2015 | accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the Hockeyville game was broadcast in Canada on [[Sportsnet]] instead of CBC.

===2016 season===
The Canadian Kraft Hockeyville finalist in the east was the Aréna St-Isidore in [[Saint-Isidore, Chaudière-Appalaches, Quebec]], and the finalist in the west was the Pat Duke Memorial Arena in [[Lumby, British Columbia]]. Lumby was named the winner on April 2, and received C$100,000 in upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nhl.com/news/lumby-is-kraft-hockeyville/c-280085766 | title=Kraft Hockeyville chooses Lumby, British Columbia | publisher=National Hockey League | date=April 3, 2016 | accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Pat Duke Memorial Arena had a limited seating capacity, the pre-season game featuring the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and the [[Edmonton Oilers]] on October 2 was instead played at [[Kal Tire Place]] in nearby [[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.vernonmorningstar.com/news/388320701.html | title=Kal Tire Place will host Kraft Hockeyville NHL pre-season game Oct. 2| work=Vernon Morning Star | date=July 26, 2016 | accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kraft Hockeyville USA finalist in the east was the [[Lakeview Arena]] in [[Marquette, Michigan]], and the finalist in the west was the Rushmore Thunderdome in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]]. Marquette was named the winner on April 30, received US$150,000 in upgrades, and hosted the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[Buffalo Sabres]] on October 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nhl.com/news/hockeyville-usa-2016-winner-is-marquette-mich/c-280524324 | title=Marquette, Mich., wins Kraft Hockeyville USA 2016 | publisher=National Hockey League | date=April 30, 2016 | accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 season===
The Canadian Kraft Hockeyville finalist in the east was the O'Leary Community Sports Centre in [[O'Leary, Prince Edward Island]], and the finalist in the west was the Ituna Skating Rink in [[Ituna, Saskatchewan]]. O'Leary was named the winner on April 2, 2017, and received C$100,000 in arena upgrades. Citing transportation and other issues with the O'Leary Community Sports Centre, the pre-season game between the [[New Jersey Devils]] and the [[Ottawa Senators]] on September 25, 2017, was instead played at the [[Consolidated Credit Union Place]] in nearby [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-hockeyville-summerside-1.4166955 | title=Kraft Hockeyville game to be played in Summerside| publisher=CBC News | date=June 19, 2017 | accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kraft Hockeyville USA finalist in the east was the [[Rostraver Ice Garden]] in [[Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania]], and the finalist in the west was the Bloomington Ice Garden in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. Belle Vernon was named the winner on April 29, 2017, and received US$150,000 in arena upgrades. Because the Rostraver Ice Garden (despite being large by community arena standards and having hosted professional sports in the preceding decade) was deemed not fit to host a pre-season game, the contest between the [[St. Louis Blues]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] on September 24, 2017, was instead played the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex in [[Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Cranberry, Butler County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Matt|last2=Peirce|first2=Paul|title=Rostraver Ice Garden deemed unfit to host Penguins preseason game|url=http://triblive.com/sports/penguins/12577553-74/rostraver-ice-garden-deemed-unfit-to-host-penguins-preseason-game|website=Trib Live|accessdate=August 4, 2017|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benderev|first1=Chris|title=Western Pa.

'''Malektronic Rocketman''' is an astronaut used as the mascot for Malektronic LLC. The Rocketman is also known as [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] Astronaut, Lighting Astronaut, and TB Astronaut.

The Rocketman came to fame during the [[2014–15 NHL season]] with main appearances occurring during the [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Rocketman has also appeared in numerous news broadcasts and on ESPN's flagship show SportsCenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ESPN helps Lightning ‘astronaut’ reach for the stars|url = http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/lightning-astronaut-to-appear-today-on-espn-telecasts-20150514/|website = TBO.com|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tampa Bay Lightning "mascot" visits ESPN - ESPN Front Row|url = http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2015/05/tampa-bay-lightning-mascot-visits-espn/|website = ESPN Front Row|access-date = 2016-01-27|language = en-US|first = Kate|last = Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Rocketman was created by Malektronic CEO Ben Malek. Rocketman was originally part of a marketing campaign in partnership with the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. Malektronic speakers were given away at the game by Rocketman. After one of the speaker give aways at a [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] game Ben decided to have the Rocketman sit in one of his glass side seats. It was shortly after when people started to notice and post pictures and questions on social media about it.

==History==
The Malektronic Rocketman (Astronaut) was originally seen at the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] vs [[Los Angeles Kings|L.A. Kings]] on February 7, 2015. However, Rocketman gained more nationwide exposure at a subsequent game on March 25, 2014 where the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] played the [[Florida Panthers]]. The video and images from that game started the Rocketman on a viral social journey that would last all the way into and through the [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs]] and well into the start of the [[2015–16 NHL season]].

==Actors==
More than one person has worn the Rocketman suit. Depending on the event they are attending there may be more than one actor donning the suit.

==Superfan vs Marketing Ploy==
There has been debate over the novelty of the Rocketman. The original social belief on the sight of an astronaut at hockey games was that it was a superfan. Latter many news agencies thought they were exposing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Truth behind Astronaut Guy at Lightning games - Sportsnet.ca|url = http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/astronaut-tampa-bay-lightning-glass-ad-speaker-malektronic-viral-playoffs/|website = Sportsnet.ca|access-date = 2016-01-28|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lightning astronaut mascot isn't some superfan, just marketing|url = https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/the-lightning-astronaut-mascot-isn-t-some-superfan--just-marketing-201824936.html|website = Yahoo Sports|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocketman by reporting its "just" some company.

While Malektronic will not deny the use of an astronaut at the games was part of some fun marketing they will still swear the superfan aspect is valid. Most of Malektronic’s employees are dedicated [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] fans and Malektronic CEO Ben Malek is a big fan of the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] fan where he is a long time season ticket holder and a Suite owner. Some fans even bestow the "Superfan" title on Ben.

==The Chicago Connection==
During the 2014-2015 Stanley Cup Championship there became an interesting twist. Rocketman was attending all home games during the Championships. Once it came down to [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] vs [[Chicago Blackhawks]] some social media and news sources found out CEO Ben Malek used to be a die hard Chicago fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chicago's connection to the Tampa Bay Lightning astronaut|url = http://www.redeyechicago.com/sports/redeye-tampa-bay-lightning-astronaut-20150602-story.html|website = redeyechicago.com|access-date = 2016-01-28|last = RedEye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben assured Tampa fans and friends he and Rocketman were still behind Tampa Bay 100% in the playoffs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14506">Players in the '''[[National Hockey League]]''' wear equipment which allows their team affiliation to be easily identified, unifying the image of the team. Currently, a NHL uniform consists of a [[hockey jersey]], [[hockey pants]], [[hockey sock|socks]], gloves, and a [[Hockey helmet#Helmets in the National Hockey League|helmet]].

==Background==
Historically, the only standardized piece of the equipment has been the sweater (jersey), which has to be of identical design by the same company for all members of a team. Other elements merely have a number scheme, allowing individual players to select their own brand and model colored to match the uniform but not necessarily identical in appearance. [[Ice hockey stick|Sticks]] and other equipment worn under the clothes have no requirements in terms of matching a team's colors; teams will sometimes provide players with team-brand [[undershirts]] or other under-clothing, but players are not required or limited to wearing them.

[[Goaltender|Goalies]] often have their pads and gloves and masks colored to match the team's color scheme, but there is no requirement for this equipment to match, and goalies who transfer to a new team often play in their old equipment until new colors can be obtained. Alternatively, players who transfer teams have sometimes had their gloves painted temporarily to match the required colors, and are given new helmets.

Each team is currently required to have two sweater designs: One with a white base (or historically, a yellow color), and one with a darker-colored base. Between the 1970-71 and 2002-03 seasons, NHL teams wore white (or yellow) uniforms at home and dark uniforms on the road (which is the current convention in some low-level ice hockey leagues). Since the 2003–04 season, NHL teams typically wear the dark color at home and the white for road games; there are occasional single-game exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;When third sweaters are worn, there are occasions when a team requests to wear their third sweater, whose color requires that game to use opposite home/away colors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page Phoenix Coyotes 2007-08 "Reverse Jersey Nights"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315113028/http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page |date=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 Los Angeles Kings Uniform History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512200754/http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only element allowed by NHL rules to be interchangeable between the two sets of equipment is the pants.

===Third Sweater Program===
Starting in 1995 (excluding a few prior isolated instances), some teams began to design a [[Third sweater#National Hockey League|third sweater]], or alternate sweater, which allowed them to experiment with new designs, or throwback to a vintage design. Though they are termed third sweaters, they can actually entail an entirely separate look from the primary equipment, often including alternate socks, and sometimes alternate helmets and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the early 2000s [[New York Rangers]] Liberty-head third sweater was a different blue than the team's road sweater, requiring alternate socks, helmets and other color-matched equipment.&lt;/ref&gt; Some third sweaters have eventually become the bases for new primary sweater designs.

Third sweaters are typically worn only a few times a season by special permission of the league, based on a list of requested games. They can also be worn during selected playoff games. The third sweater program, as the NHL came to call it, was temporarily suspended on two occasions: for the 2007–08 season (due to logistics problems with the introduction of the Reebok Edge sweater that was unveiled at the [[2007 NHL All-Star Game]]) and for the 2017–18 season (due to the introduction of the Adidas sweater).

A team's desire to wear their third sweater sometimes requires the opposing team to wear their home or road sweater when the opposite would be normally worn, due to the color of the third sweater. This can occur when a road team wishes to wear a colored third sweater, or a home team wishes to wear a white third sweater, as there must be one team each wearing white and colored uniforms in a game. This can require a team to carry two sets of uniforms and equipment on the road, whether they are using their third sweaters, or are playing against a team who is. As of the 2018-19 season, the [[New Jersey Devils]] (sweater modeled after the home sweater the team wore from 1982 to 1992) are the only team to wear a white third sweater. The [[Washington Capitals]] (2011 Winter Classic sweater modeled after the sweater the team wore from 1974 to 1995) were the only NHL team to have a white third sweater from the 2011-12 season to the 2014-15 season, when they were replaced by red sweaters of the same design. The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] used a special white third sweater for their 50th anniversary in the 2016–17 season.

==Sweaters==
As hockey originates as an outdoor winter sport where players wore sweaters, this terminology has been retained to describe what is probably the most recognized element of a team's equipment (which is the only element  which is mass marketed to the public).

Most NHL sweaters (jerseys) display the team's primary [[logo]] in the center of the chest, while some also display secondary logos on the shoulders. Each player in a team's lineup for a game must have a different [[Squad number#Ice hockey|number]] displayed on the back of their sweater, as well as the player's surname above their number on the back of their sweater. While not required, teams typically place their numbers on each upper arm as well. Team [[Captain (hockey)|captains]] and alternate captains wear the letters "C" and "A" respectively on the front of their sweaters. Sweaters have a loop of fabric sewn into the inside back, called a "fight strap" or "tie-down", which must be secured to the player's pants during a game, to prevent the sweater from being pulled over the player's head in a fight. Players normally get a new jersey every ten or so games, although due to other reasons players may get another jersey sooner.

In recent years, teams have sold both "pro" model sweaters, ostensibly identical to those worn by players, and "replica" quality sweaters which are cheaper versions that typically use cheaper production methods and lower-quality materials. Replica versions typically lack the fight strap, and in recent years have an additional brand logo on the left wrist. 

===History===
Prior to 2000, different NHL teams had contracts with different manufacturers for their sweaters, although in some years all or most teams had a deal with one supplier.  Manufacturers included [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]], [[Koho (company)|Koho]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starter (clothing line)|Starter]], and [[Fruit of the Loom|Pro Player]].

====2000–07====
From the 2000–01 season, up to the 2005–06 NHL season, all team sweaters were made by The Hockey Company in an NHL-wide deal, and were branded with subsidiary brands. The [[Koho (company)|Koho]] brand was on dark sweaters and third sweaters, while the [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]] brand was on the white sweaters. The Hockey Company began the practice of putting the manufacturer's logo on the back of the sweater, below the neck, rather than on the back of the waist hem, as had previously been the practice. [[Jofa]], another subsidiary, made the sweaters for referees and linesmen until the 2005–06 season, when they were re-branded CCM which they remain as of 2008–09.

Following [[Reebok]]'s purchase of The Hockey Company, all official NHL team sweaters were switched to the Reebok (Rbk Hockey) brand (which is more familiar to the general public), while cheaper replica sweaters sold to fans retained the CCM branding. Reebok logos are on the side boards in all NHL arenas (for marketing purposes) just above the blue and red lines.

====2007-2017: Reebok Edge{{anchor|RbkEdge}}====
&lt;!-- This section is wikilinked from [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] --&gt;
The ''Rbk Edge'', or simply ''Edge'', is a newer line of sweaters designed by [[Reebok]]. They were announced by Reebok after nearly three years of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Edge sweaters were unveiled at the [[55th National Hockey League All-Star Game]] and began to be worn, league-wide, from the [[2007–08 NHL season]] onwards. Almost every team in the league made at least minor changes to their equipment design in conjunction with implementing the new sweater style. The [[San Jose Sharks]], [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Dallas Stars]], and [[Washington Capitals]] redesigned their equipment altogether with a new or updated logo. The [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and [[Minnesota Wild]] used their [[third sweater|alternate sweater]] from the previous three seasons as the basis for their new look, complete with the team adopting the alternate logo from their alternates as their primary logo.

Five of the [[Original Six]] teams (excluding the [[Boston Bruins]]) as well as the [[New Jersey Devils]] kept their previous styles intact when possible, with the Devils going as far as to issue a [[press release]] saying that the team had no plans for an event unveiling the Rbk Edge design, because there was nothing new to see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nhluniforms.com/TwoThousands.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228155500/http://nhluniforms.com/TwoThousands.html |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anaheim Ducks]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]], who both had just redesigned their sweaters the year before the implementation of the Edge sweaters, also left theirs mostly unchanged. But the Sabres made the logo on the front of their sweater smaller and took away the silver outline on their white away sweater, and the Ducks added orange piping to their sweater's neckline.

Along with the traditional differences between the replica and authentic versions of NHL sweaters, the replica (billed as "premier") versions of the Edge sweater sold to the public have a "jock tag" on the left side of the front near the waist with the Reebok vector, NHL logo, and sweater size.

Citing player complaints, Reebok later modified the Edge sweaters, removing the play-dry material in the front and making the sleeves bigger. The modified sweaters, dubbed the ''Edge II'', made their debut at the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic]] on January 1, 2008. On that occasion, the participating Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins both used throwback designs for the jerseys.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017–present: Adidas ADIZERO====
In 2015, the NHL and [[Adidas]] announced plans for Adidas to begin manufacturing official NHL jerseys starting in the 2017–18 season. All jerseys are owned by the NHL. On June 20, 2017, the NHL unveiled new ADIZERO sweaters for each of the 31 teams, including the first uniform for the league's newest team, the [[Vegas Golden Knights]]. The new sweaters are advertised as being lighter, cooler, and stronger than previous jerseys. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Public Relations | first = NHL | title = NHL, adidas unveil uniforms | publisher = NHL Public Relations | date = June 20, 2017|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-jerseys-by-adidas-unveiled-for-2017-18-season/c-290020400 | accessdate = June 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the change, there were no third "alternate" jerseys for any NHL teams for the 2017–18 season. When the third jersey program resumed the next season, teams were given the option of wearing either one-off "Heritage" alternates (normally throwback designs of past sweaters), full-time third jerseys, or both.

As of 2020, the NHL is the only one of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional American sports leagues]] whose uniforms are not outfitted by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. However, Nike did outfit a few NHL teams in the past, most notably with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] during the [[Wayne Gretzky]] era, and during the late 1990s for a few select teams.

==Other equipment==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
A team's gear also includes color requirements for other equipment, while not requiring players to use a specific brand or model, so they may select equipment to their preferences. This includes a player's gloves, pants, and helmet. Socks are also part of the design, historically with some pattern of horizontal stripes. CCM/Reebok has been a frequent supplier of player equipment and skates.

There is a sock and pant design by Reebok with similar technological improvements and design intentions.

==History==
A number of ice hockey leagues for players of African descent formed in Canada as early as the late-19th century. The [[Coloured Hockey League]] was an all-black ice hockey league established in 1895. Operating across the [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] of Canada, the league operated for several decades until 1930. 

Although other ice hockey leagues saw integration in the early 20th century (including the [[Quebec Senior Hockey League]]), the NHL did not see its first non-white player until March 13, 1948, when [[Larry Kwong]] broke the NHL's colour barrier playing with the [[New York Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Rachel|title=NHL trailblazer Larry Kwong dies at 94|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/larry-kwong-calgary-nhl-1.4582793|publisher=''[[CBC News]]''|accessdate=19 March 2018|language=en|date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Vernon, British Columbia]], Kwong was a [[Chinese Canadian]] of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;NHL, [http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=377919 "CBC targets Chinese hockey fans with Mandarin broadcasts of NHL playoffs"], Canadian Press, 2008 April 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, [[Fred Sasakamoose]] was the first [[Cree]] NHL player, and the first Canadian [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous]] player in the NHL, debuting with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. On January 18, 1958, [[Willie O'Ree]] became the first [[Black Canadian]] to play in the NHL. Playing with the [[Boston Bruins]], he was also the first NHL player of African-descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Cecil |title=Breaking the Ice: The Black Experience in Professional Hockey |date=2003 |publisher=Insomniac Press |location=Toronto |isbn=1897415052 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E74agb2dk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=nhl+%22willie+o%27ree%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4gavFqtnYAhUa0IMKHT8KAKkQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=nhl%20%22willie%20o'ree%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Val James]] was the first [[African American]] player to play in the NHL. James signed his contract with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Black American NHL Player 2015"&gt;"IAs First Black American NHL Player, Enforcer Was Defenseless Vs. Racism."

This is a seemingly minor yet significant change in the racial demographic of the NHL in its hundred-year history.&lt;ref name="wsbtv.com"/&gt;

In addition to black and white players, other races and ethnicities represented in the NHL (in the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18]] season) include players of [[Middle Eastern]]-descent (including [[Brandon Saad]], [[Justin Abdelkader]], [[Mika Zibanejad]], and [[Nazem Kadri]]), players of [[Latino]]-descent (including [[Al Montoya]], [[Auston Matthews]], [[Max Pacioretty]], and [[Raffi Torres]]), and players of [[Asian people|Asian]]-descent (including [[Kailer Yamamoto]], and [[Matthew Dumba]]).

In the NHL's standings system, a team is awarded 2 points for a win (regardless if earned in regulation or [[overtime (sports)|overtime]]), 1 point for a [[tie (draw)#Ice hockey|tie]], 1 point for an overtime loss, and 0 points for a loss.&lt;ref name=Silver2015&gt;{{cite news|author-link=Nate Silver|last=Silver|first=Nate|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-radical-proposal-to-destroy-the-nhls-loser-point/|title=A Radical Proposal To Destroy The NHL's Loser Point|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], which canceled the entire [[2004–05 NHL season|2004–05 season]], the league adopted a shootout featuring shots on goals, in order to determine the winner of a game which is still tied after an overtime period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-10-05-nhl-edit_x.htm|title=Fit to be tied|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 5, 2005|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adoption, introduced in the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], eliminated ties from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26395|title=NHL Adopts Shootout|website=National Hockey League|date=July 22, 2005|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Hockey League''' ('''NHL'''; {{lang-fr|Ligue nationale de hockey—LNH}}) is a professional [[ice hockey]] [[sports league|league]] in North America, currently comprising 31 teams: 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world,&lt;ref name="premier"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Hockey League |first=James |last=Marsh |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/national-hockey-league/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2006 |accessdate=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]].

The National Hockey League was organized on November 26, 1917, at the [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]] in [[Montreal]] after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in [[Renfrew, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;''The National Hockey League Official Record Book &amp; Guide 2009'' 77th Edition, p. 9. New York: National Hockey League (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and folds left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926.

At its inception, the NHL had four teams—all in Canada, thus the adjective "National" in the league's name. The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the [[Boston Bruins]] joined, and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams. From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the "[[Original Six]]". The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the [[1967 NHL expansion]]. The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979. Between 1991 and 2000, the NHL further expanded to 30 teams. It added its 31st team in 2017 and has approved the addition of a 32nd team in 2021.

The league's headquarters have been in [[New York City]] since 1989 when the head office moved there from Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Jack|title=Americans and Bettman have stolen Canada's game|url=https://calgaryherald.com/sports/opinion+americans+bettman+have+stolen+canada+game/7251426/story.html|accessdate=January 31, 2018|work=Calgary Herald|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|labour-management dispute]] that led to the cancellation of the entire [[2004–05 NHL season|2004–05 season]], the league resumed play in 2005–06 under a new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective agreement]] that included a [[salary cap]]. In [[2008–09 NHL season|2009]], the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships, attendance, and television audiences.&lt;ref name=JohnCollins&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aGY7pu.INAhA|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|title=NHL Borrows From NFL as It Pursues Bigger TV Contract|first=Curtis|last=Eichelberger|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current NHL champions are the [[St. Louis Blues]], who defeated the Boston Bruins four games to three in the [[2019 Stanley Cup Finals]].

{{NHLHistory}}
{{Main|History of the National Hockey League}}

===Early years===
The National Hockey League was established in 1917 as the successor to the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Founded in 1909, the NHA [[1910 NHA season|began play one year later]] with seven teams in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey. But by [[1916–17 NHA season|the NHA's eighth season]], a series of disputes with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] led team owners of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]], [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], and [[Quebec Bulldogs]] to hold a meeting to discuss the league's future.&lt;ref name="mcfarlane_15_16"&gt;{{harvnb|McFarlane|1997|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the NHA constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out, the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA, and on November 26, 1917, formed the National Hockey League. [[Frank Calder]] was chosen as its first president, serving until his death in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulldogs were unable to play, and the remaining owners created a new team in Toronto, the [[Toronto Arenas|Arenas]], to compete with the Canadiens, Wanderers and Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first games were played on December 19, 1917.&lt;ref name="Jenish 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenish|first1=D'Arcy|title=The NHL : 100 years of on-ice action and boardroom battles|date=2013|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=0385671466|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Montreal Arena]] burned down in January 1918, causing the Wanderers to cease operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Leagues and the Birth of the NHL |url=http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;bcid=his_EarlyLeagues |last=McFarlane |first=Brian |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=January 17, 2010 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130110236/http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page |archivedate=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NHL continued on as a three-team league until the Bulldogs returned in 1919.&lt;ref name="pincus24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup, which was an interleague competition back then. Toronto won the first NHL title, and then defeated the [[Vancouver Millionaires]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) for the [[1918 Stanley Cup Finals|1918 Stanley Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadiens won the league title in 1919; however their Stanley Cup Final against the PCHA's [[Seattle Metropolitans]] was abandoned as a result of the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]] epidemic.&lt;ref name="pincus23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montreal in 1924 won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]], won the regular season title in [[1924–25 NHL season|1924–25]] but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto St. Patricks]] (formerly the Arenas) in the semi-final. Montreal was then defeated by the [[Victoria Cougars]] of the [[Western Hockey League (1952–1974)|Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) for the [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|1925 Stanley Cup]]. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the trophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&amp;year=1924-25 |title=Victoria Cougars—1924–25 Stanley Cup |accessdate=January 17, 2010 |work=Legends of Hockey |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930080728/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=STC&amp;year=1924-25 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Stanley Cup became the ''de facto'' NHL championship in 1926 after the WCHL ceased operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Hockey League embarked on rapid expansion in the 1920s, adding the [[Montreal Maroons]] and [[Boston Bruins]] in 1924. The Bruins were the first American team in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://bruins.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=5489 |title=The History of the Hub of Hockey |accessdate=May 16, 2008 |publisher=Boston Bruins Hockey Club |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501130542/http://bruins.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=5489 |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Americans]] began play in 1925 after purchasing the assets of the Hamilton Tigers, and were joined by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Rangers]] were added in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit Cougars]] (later Red Wings) were also added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct WCHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group purchased the Toronto St. Patricks in 1927 and immediately renamed them the Maple Leafs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Original Six===
{{main|Original Six}}
The first [[NHL All-Star Game]] was held in 1934 to benefit [[Ace Bailey]], whose career ended on a vicious hit by [[Eddie Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was held in 1937 in support of [[Howie Morenz]]'s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league. The Pirates became the [[Philadelphia Quakers (NHL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] in 1930, then folded one year later. The Senators likewise became the [[St. Louis Eagles]] in 1934, also lasting only one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maroons did not survive, as they suspended operations in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans were suspended in 1942 due to a lack of available players, and were never reactivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league was reduced to six teams for the [[1942–43 NHL season]]: the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. These six teams remained constant for 25 years, a period known as the Original Six. The league reached an agreement with the Stanley Cup trustees in 1947 to take full control of the trophy, allowing the NHL to reject challenges from other leagues that wished to play for the Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Dan |author2=Zweig, Eric |author3=Duplacey, James |title=The Ultimate Prize: The Stanley Cup |year=2003 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=0-7407-3830-5 | page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Original Six expansion===
By the mid-1960s, the desire for a network television contract in the U.S., and concerns that the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup, spurred the league to undertake its first [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion]] since the 1920s. The league doubled in size to 12 teams for the [[1967–68 NHL season|1967–68 season]], adding the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Minnesota North Stars]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[California Seals]] and [[St. Louis Blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|1991|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the league responded by adding the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in [[1970–71 NHL season|1970]] along with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], who are both located on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |McFarlane |1990 |pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the emergence of the newly founded [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) led the league to add the [[New York Islanders]] and [[Atlanta Flames]] to keep the rival league out of those markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boer|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Kansas City Scouts]] were added, bringing the league up to 18 teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Hockey League fought the WHA for players, losing 67 to the new league in its first season of [[1972–73 WHA season|1972–73]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Bobby Hull]], who signed a ten-year, $2.5&amp;nbsp;million contract with the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], the largest in hockey history at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league attempted to block the defections in court, but a counter-suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL's [[reserve clause]] to be illegal, thus eliminating the elder league's monopoly over the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues, leading to a 1979 [[NHL–WHA merger|merger agreement]] that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets, [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]] and [[Quebec Nordiques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote, but a massive boycott of [[Molson Brewery]] products by fans in Canada caused the Montreal Canadiens, which was owned by Molson, to reverse its position, along with the Vancouver Canucks. In a second vote the plan was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Gretzky]] played one season in the WHA for the [[Indianapolis Racers]] (eight games) and the [[Edmonton Oilers]] (72 games) before the Oilers joined the National Hockey League for the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80 season]].&lt;ref name="LOHGretzky"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&amp;page=bio&amp;list=#photo |title=The Legends—Wayne Gretzky |accessdate=January 18, 2010 |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123203450/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&amp;page=bio&amp;list=#photo |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988, and set single season records for goals (92 in [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82]]), assists (163 in [[1985–86 NHL season|1985–86]]) and points (215 in 1985–86), as well as career records for goals (894), assists (1,963) and points (2,857).&lt;ref name="LOHGretzky" /&gt; He was traded to the Kings in 1988, a deal that dramatically improved the league's popularity in the United States. By the turn of the century nine more teams were added to the NHL: the [[San Jose Sharks]], [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], [[Florida Panthers]], [[Nashville Predators]], [[Atlanta Thrashers]] (now [[Winnipeg Jets]]), and in 2000 the [[Minnesota Wild]] and [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].&lt;ref name="EOHGretzky"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/dynasty_highlights_gretzkytrade.html |title=Edmonton's Saddest Hockey Day—The Gretzky Trade |accessdate=January 18, 2010 |publisher=Edmonton Oilers Heritage Foundation |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201052918/https://www.oilersheritage.com/history/dynasty_highlights_gretzkytrade.html |archivedate=February 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2015, the NHL confirmed that it had received applications from prospective ownership groups in [[Quebec City]] and [[Las Vegas]] for possible expansion teams,&lt;ref name="NHL update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=775295|title=Update on NHL expansion application process|website=National Hockey League|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 22, 2016, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the addition of a 31st franchise, based in Las Vegas and later named the [[Vegas Golden Knights]], into the NHL for the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref name="Vegas expansion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Dan|title=Las Vegas awarded NHL franchise|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-expands-to-las-vegas/c-281010682?tid=281011650|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2018, the league announced a 32nd franchise in [[Seattle NHL team|Seattle]] to begin play in the 2021–22 season.&lt;ref name="Seattle expansion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Dan|title=Seattle NHL expansion approved by Board of Governors|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/seattle-nhl-expansion-approved-to-be-32nd-team-play-in-2021-22/c-302581450|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|website=NHL.com|date=December 4, 2018|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four league-wide work stoppages in league history, all happening since [[1991–92 NHL season|1992]].
The first was a [[1992 NHL strike|strike]] by the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] in April 1992 which lasted for ten days, but the strike was settled quickly and all affected games were rescheduled.&lt;ref name="labour_history"&gt;{{Cite news|title=We've been here before |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/flashback.html |author=CBC Sports |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=January 29, 2004 |accessdate=June 9, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409050550/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/flashback.html |archivedate=April 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[1994–95 NHL lockout|lockout]] at the start of the [[1994–95 NHL season|1994–95 season]] forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to just 48, with the teams playing only intra-conference games during the reduced season.&lt;ref name="labour_history" /&gt; The resulting [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) was set for renegotiation in 1998 and extended to September 15, 2004.&lt;ref name="2004_lockout"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The hockey lockout of 2004–05 |last=audohar |first=Paul D. |journal=Monthly Labor Review |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/12/art3full.pdf |date=December 2005|format=PDF |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired on September 15, 2004, league commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]] of the players union and closed the league's head office.&lt;ref name="2004_lockout" /&gt; The league vowed to install what it dubbed "cost certainty" for its teams, but the Players' Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a [[salary cap]], which the union initially said it would not accept. The lockout shut down the league for 310 days, the longest in sports history, as the NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season.&lt;ref name="2004_lockout" /&gt; A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July 2005, including a salary cap. The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term, allowing the league to resume as of the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]].&lt;ref name="2004_lockout" /&gt;

On October 5, 2005, the first post-lockout season took to the ice with all 30 teams. The NHL received record attendance in the 2005–06 season: an average of 16,955 per game.&lt;ref name="season_review"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/hockey_features/season_review.html |title=A season to remember |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |first=John |last=Molinaro |date=April 20, 2006 |accessdate=June 9, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618174146/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/hockey_features/season_review.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The League's TV audience was slower to rebound because of American cable broadcaster [[ESPN]]'s decision to drop the sport.&lt;ref name="ibisworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=107 |title=Super Bowl XLII versus the Economy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603025811/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=107 |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's post-lockout agreement with [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] gave the league a share of revenue from each game's advertising sales, rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights. The league's annual revenues were estimated at approximately $2.27&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="ibisworld"/&gt;

At midnight September 16, 2012, the labour pact expired, and the league again locked out the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On ice: NHL locks out its players|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57513713/on-ice-nhl-locks-out-its-players/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners proposed reducing the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 47 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/8382911/nhl-officially-locks-players-cba-expires |title=NHL imposes league-wide lockout |first= Katie |last=Strang | publisher=ESPNNewYork.com |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All games were cancelled up to January 14, 2013, as well as the [[2013 NHL Winter Classic]] and the [[2015 National Hockey League All-Star Game|2013 NHL All-Star Weekend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL announces cancellation of 2012–13 regular-season schedule through January 14|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=648084|website=National Hockey League|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013WinterClassic-cancelled"&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL cancels 2013 Winter Classic|url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/11/02/nhl-cancels-2013-winter-classic/related/|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013AllStar-cancelled"&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL cancels games through Dec. 14, All-Star game|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57553761/nhl-cancels-games-through-dec-14-all-star-game/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dec30-cancelled"&gt;{{cite web|agency=The Canadian Press |title=NHL Announces Game Cancellations Through Dec. 30 |publisher=The Sports Network |date=December 10, 2012 |url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=411343 |accessdate=December 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211112604/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=411343 |archivedate=December 11, 2012 }}

===Player safety issues===
Player safety has become a major issue and concussions, which result from a hard hit to the head, have been the biggest cause. With recent studies showing how concussions can affect retired players and how it has decreased their quality of life after retirement, concussions have become a very important topic of debate when it comes to player safety issues. This had significant effects on the league as elite players were being taken out of the game, such as [[Sidney Crosby]] being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months, which adversely affected the league's marketability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Josh Hargreaves |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/crosby-discusses-lengthy-recovery-road-from-concussions-safety-of-the-game/article14118504/ |title=Crosby discusses lengthy recovery road from concussions, safety of the game |work=The Globe and Mail |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2009, [[Brendan Shanahan]] was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of senior vice-president of player safety. Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high-profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits, such as [[Raffi Torres]] receiving 25 games for his hit on [[Marián Hossa|Marian Hossa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/21/video-brendan-shanahan-explains-raffi-torres-25-game-suspension/ |title=Video: Brendan Shanahan Explains Raffi Torres’ 25 Game Suspension « CBS Chicago |publisher=Chicago.cbslocal.com |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To aid with removing high speed collisions on icing, which had led to several potential career-ending injuries such as Hurricanes' defenceman [[Joni Pitkänen|Joni Pitkanen]], the league mandated hybrid no-touch icing for the 2013–14 NHL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyshynski |first=Greg |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-players-approve-hybrid-icing-safety-trumps-subjectivity-231456246--nhl.html |title=NHL players approve hybrid icing, as safety trumps subjectivity &amp;#124; Puck Daddy|work=Yahoo! Sports |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2013, ten former players (Gary Leeman, Rick Vaive, Brad Aitken, Darren Banks, Curt Bennett, Richie Dunn, Warren Holmes, Bob Manno, Blair Stewart and Morris Titanic) sued the league for negligence on protecting players from concussions. The suit came three months after the [[National Football League]] agreed to pay former players US$765&amp;nbsp;million due to a player safety lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=437509 |title=Former NHL players sue league over concussions |publisher=The Sports Network |date=November 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131131031/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=437509 |archivedate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the NHL===
From 1952 to 1955, [[Marguerite Norris]] served as president of the Detroit Red Wings, the first woman NHL executive and the first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup. In 1992, [[Manon Rhéaume|Manon Rheaume]] became the first woman to play a game in any of the major professional North American sports leagues, as a goaltender for the Tampa Bay Lightning in an NHL pre-season game against the [[St. Louis Blues]], stopping seven of nine shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=642005|title=Part 1: Manon Rhéaume shatters hockey's gender barrier|website=National Hockey League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whockey.com/profile/canada/rheaume.html|title=Manon Rheaume}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Dawn Braid was hired as the [[Arizona Coyotes]]' skating coach, making her the first female full-time coach in the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bieler |first=Des |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/08/24/nhls-first-female-full-time-coach-hired-by-arizona-coyotes/ |title=NHL's first female full-time coach hired by Arizona Coyotes |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female referees in the NHL were hired in a test-run during the league's preseason prospect tournaments in September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhl.com/news/women-referees-at-nhl-prospect-tournament/c-309020390&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
===Board of Governors===
&lt;!-- NHL Board of Governors redirects to this section; please fix that incoming redirect if this section header is changed. Thanks! --&gt;
{{see also|List of NHL franchise owners}}
The Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the National Hockey League. In this context, each team is a member of the league, and each member appoints a Governor (usually the owner of the club), and two alternates to the Board. The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner, [[Jeremy Jacobs]]. The Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the league, and to uphold its constitution. Some of the responsibilities of the Board of Governors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/646798 |title=NHL's secret constitution revealed |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Kevin |last=McGran |date=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* review and approve any rule changes to the game.
* hiring and firing of the commissioner.
* review and approve the purchase, sale, or relocation of any member club.
* review and approve the salary caps for member clubs.
* review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule.

The Board of Governors meets twice per year, in the months of June and December, with the exact date and place to be fixed by the Commissioner.

===Executives===
The chief executive of the league is [[NHL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]]. Some of the principal decision makers who serve under the authority of the commissioner include:
* Deputy Commissioner &amp; Chief Legal Officer: [[Bill Daly]]
* Executive VP &amp; CFO: Craig Harnett
* Chief Operating Officer: Steve McArdle
* Executive VP &amp; Director of Hockey Operations: [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]]
* NHL Enterprises: Ed Horne
* Senior Vice-President of Player Safety: [[George Parros]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhl.com/news/george-parros-to-head-department-of-player-safety-focus-on-slashing/c-290910754&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NHL Labelled Map|realignment=yes|float=right}}
{{anchor|2013 Conference Realignment}}

The NHL consists of 31 teams, 24 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada. The NHL divides the 31 teams into two conferences: the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] and the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. Each conference is split into two [[Division (sport)|divisions]]: the Eastern Conference contains 16 teams (eight per division), while the Western Conference has 15 teams (seven in the Central Division and eight in the Pacific Division). The current alignment has existed since the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]].

The number of NHL teams held constant at 30 teams from the [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01 season]] when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams, until 2017. That expansion capped a period in the 1990s of rapid expansion and relocation when the NHL added nine teams to grow from 21 to 30 teams, and relocated four teams mostly from smaller northern cities (e.g., Hartford, Quebec) to larger warmer metropolitan areas (e.g., Dallas, Phoenix). The league has not contracted any teams since the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] folded in 1978. The league expanded for the first time in 17 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heitner |first1=Darren |title=The NHL Leads the Way in Bringing Pro Sports to Las Vegas |url=http://www.inc.com/darren-heitner/nhl-leads-the-way-in-bringing-pro-sports-to-las-vegas.html |magazine=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] |date=June 22, 2016|access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 31 teams in 2017 with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights&lt;ref name="Vegas expansion "/&gt; and then approved a 32nd team in [[Seattle NHL team|Seattle]] that will begin playing in the 2021–22 season.&lt;ref name="Seattle expansion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Geoff|title=After years of trying and a cast of characters in between, the NHL will finally put a team in Seattle|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/hockey/after-years-of-trying-and-a-cast-of-characters-in-between-the-nhl-will-finally-put-a-team-in-seattle/|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 3, 2018|accessdate=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Forbes]]'', in 2018, all five of the most valuable teams were "[[Original Six]]" teams: the New York Rangers at approximately $1.55&amp;nbsp;billion, the Toronto Maple Leafs at $1.45&amp;nbsp;billion, the Montreal Canadiens at $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion, the Chicago Blackhawks at $1.05&amp;nbsp;billion, and the Boston Bruins at $925&amp;nbsp;million. At least eight NHL clubs operate at a loss. NHL teams are susceptible to the Canadian–U.S. exchange rate: revenue from tickets, local and national advertising in Canada, and local and national Canadian media rights are collected in [[Canadian dollars]], but all players' salaries are paid in U.S. dollars regardless of whether a team is located in Canada or the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/montreal-canadiens/falling-dollar-boosts-salaries-for-p-k-subban-and-other-nhl-players-on-canadian-teams |title=Falling dollar boosts salaries for P.K.

==Game==
{{Main|Ice hockey}}
[[File:NHL Logo former.svg|left|upright|thumb|NHL logo, used from 1946 until 2005]]
Each National Hockey League regulation game is 60 minutes long. The game is composed of three 20-minute periods with an intermission between periods.&lt;ref name="intermission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule90.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817022955/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule90.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 17, 2000 |title=Time of match |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 2, 2006 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the end of regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, three-on-three [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] period, in which whoever scores a goal first will win the game.

[[File:WeaverLankow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Los Angeles Kings]]' [[Mike Weaver (hockey)|Mike Weaver]] clearing the puck away from [[Calgary Flames]]' [[Daymond Langkow]], December 21, 2005.]]
If the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#North American shootout|shootout]]. Three players for each team in turn take a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden-death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/rules/a/shootout_debate_2.htm |title=How the NHL Shootout Works |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Jamie |work=About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics; shootout statistics are tracked separately.

There are no shootouts during the [[NHL Playoffs|playoffs]]. Instead, multiple sudden-death, 20-minute five-on-five periods are played until one team scores. Two games have reached six overtime periods, but none have gone beyond six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Oh, what a night ... and morning.

==Hockey rink==
[[File:NHL Hockey Rink.svg|thumb|Diagram of an NHL hockey rink: {{ordered list |penalty boxes |team benches |scorekeepers' area}}]]
{{Main|Hockey rink}}
National Hockey League games are played on a rectangular [[hockey rink]] with rounded corners surrounded by walls and [[Plexiglas]]. It measures {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=4}} by {{convert|85|ft|m|sigfig=4}} in the NHL,&lt;ref name="rink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule02.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409150309/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule02.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 9, 2006 |title=Dimensions of Rink |year=2005 |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately the same length but much narrower than [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] standards. The [[Hockey rink#Lines|centre line]] divides the ice in half,&lt;ref name="lines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule05.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621025953/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule05.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 21, 2009 |title=Division of ice surface |year=2005 |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to judge [[icing (ice hockey)|icing violations]]. There are two [[Hockey rink#Lines|blue lines]] that divide the rink roughly into thirds, delineating one neutral and two attacking [[Hockey rink#Zones|zones]].&lt;ref name="lines" /&gt; Near the end of both ends of the rink, there is a thin red ''goal line'' spanning the width of the ice, which is used to judge [[Goal (hockey)|goals]] and icing calls.

A trapezoidal area behind each goal net has been introduced.&lt;ref name="crease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule04.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606090924/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule04.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 6, 2009 |title=Goal crease |year=2005 |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goaltender can play the puck only within [[No play zone|the trapezoid]] or in front of the goal line; if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area, a two-minute minor penalty for [[Delay of game (ice hockey)|delay of game]] is assessed.&lt;ref name="crease_penalty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26355|title=Rule 63 – Delaying the Game|year=2009|website=National Hockey League|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is unofficially nicknamed the "[[Martin Brodeur]] rule".&lt;ref name="Diamos2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616F835550C758DDDA00894DD404482|title=New Rule Will Take a Weapon Away from Brodeur|date=September 16, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]] (subscription required)|author=Diamos, Jason.|accessdate=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/18/Sports/Brodeur_not_handling_.shtml |title=Brodeur not handling new rule well |date=September 18, 2005 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |author=Jones, Tom. |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206171542/http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/18/Sports/Brodeur_not_handling_.shtml |archivedate=February 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid/ |title=Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid |year=2009 |work=Fire&amp;Ice |accessdate=November 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113050802/http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL decides to keep trapezoid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/nhl_decides_to_keep_trapezoid/|title=NHL decides to keep trapezoid|year=2009|work=Fire&amp;Ice|accessdate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2013–14 season, the league trimmed the goal frames by {{convert|4|in|cm}} on each side and reduced the size of the goalies' leg pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=684940|title=Hybrid Icying tops list of rules changes for 2013–2014 season|last=Rosen|first=Dan|website=National Hockey League|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
{{main|National Hockey League rules}}
The National Hockey League's rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world. The rules themselves have evolved directly from the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor ice hockey game]] in Montreal in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing [[List of ice hockey leagues#Minor professional|most professional]] and [[Canadian Hockey League|major junior ice hockey leagues]] in North America. Infractions of the rules, such as [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent [[face-off]]s, while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games.

The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot was adopted from the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005–06 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the "offside pass" or "two-line pass" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.&lt;ref name="newoffside"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC sports |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 22, 2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516050646/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |archivedate=May 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the league reinstated the "tag-up offside" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.&lt;ref name="newoffside" /&gt; The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,&lt;ref name="newoffside" /&gt; which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the [[neutral zone trap]]. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing the puck]] they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following [[face-off]] (except to replace an injured player or re-install a [[extra attacker|pulled goaltender]]).&lt;ref name="icing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514155000/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |title=Icing |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the league has used ''hybrid icing'', where a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.&lt;ref name="icing" /&gt;

The league's rules differ from the rules of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), as used in tournaments such as the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]], which were themselves derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}} In the NHL, [[Fighting in ice hockey|fighting]] leads to ''major penalties'' while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players.&lt;ref name="major"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154838/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Major penalties |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fighting_iihf"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |title=Ice Hockey Essentials – International vs. NHL |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |year=2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221192349/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |archivedate = February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus [[short-handed]] for the duration of the penalty,&lt;ref name="minor" /&gt; but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength. Also, unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play.&lt;ref name="minor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule26.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154633/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule26.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Minor penalties |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHL and IIHF differ also in playing rules, such as icing, the areas of play for goaltenders, helmet rules, officiating rules, timeouts and play reviews.

The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players. Players are banned from [[gambling]] and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023064426/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season structure==
{{Main|Season structure of the NHL}}
{{See also|List of NHL seasons}}
The National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]).

Teams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight [[exhibition game]]s. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.

During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. In the regular season, each team plays 82 games: 41 games each of home and road. Eastern teams play 28 games in their own geographic division—four against each of their seven other divisional opponents—and 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference. Western teams play 26 or 29 games in their own geographic division—four or five against each of their six or seven other divisional opponents—and 21 or 24 games against the six or seven remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference, with one cross-division intra-conference match-up occurring in four games. All teams play every team in the other conference twice—home and road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHL ramps up rivalries |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216 |author=CBC Sports Online |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 27, 2005 |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927195147/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league's regular season standings are based on a point system. Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league's overall leader is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].

The Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points.&lt;ref name="nhl_playoff_format"&gt;{{cite web|website=National Hockey League |title=Playoff formats |year=2005 |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718071657/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Final. In all rounds, the higher-ranked team is awarded home-ice advantage, with four of the seven games played at this team's home venue. In the Stanley Cup Final, the team with the most points during the regular season has home-ice advantage.

==Entry Draft==
{{Main|NHL Entry Draft}}

The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven-round off-season [[Draft (sports)|draft]] held in late June. Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 28th and 29th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 30th pick and the Stanley Cup champions the 31st pick.

==Trophies and awards==
{{Main|List of National Hockey League awards}}

===Teams===
[[File:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stanley Cup]], on display at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], is awarded annually to the league champion.]]
The most prestigious team award is the [[Stanley Cup]], which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].

The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have three more.

The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60.&lt;ref name="list_stanley_cup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all-time.&lt;ref name="greatest team"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 1999 |accessdate=June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.

The same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its Canadian Football League [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.

===Players===
There are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the [[goaltender]](s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.

The other player trophies are voted on by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] or the team general managers.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-awards-trophies |title=NHL trophies|website=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.

[[File:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|The [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]]]
In addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the [[Jack Adams Award]] as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association.

In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players, who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters, the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played. Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia into the NHL. Swedes, Finns, and other Western Europeans, who were always free to move to North America, came to the league in greater numbers than before.

Many of the league's top players in recent years have come from these European countries including [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Erik Karlsson]], [[Henrik Sedin]], [[Daniel Sedin]], [[Henrik Lundqvist]], [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]], [[Patrik Eliáš|Patrik Elias]], [[Zdeno Chára|Zdeno Chara]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Evgeni Malkin]], [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] and [[Alexander Ovechkin]].&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New world order: as the Olympics have shown, the influx of players from across the Atlantic brought changes to the NHL game |work=The Sporting News |date=February 25, 2002 |accessdate=June 11, 2006 |first=Larry |last=Wigge |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_8_226/ai_83450464 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419061539/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_8_226/ai_83450464 |archivedate=April 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more "skilled offensive players",&lt;ref name="europe2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadians left behind as NHL goes for firepower |agency=The Canadian Press |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 11, 2006 |first=Bill |last=Beacon |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyNHLDraft99/jun27_can.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070623032604/http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyNHLDraft99/jun27_can.html |archivedate=June 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although recently{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league.&lt;ref name="More Americans?"&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL landscape changes |website=IIHF |date=May 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |first=ANDREW |last=PODNIEKS |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/browse/2/article/nhl-landscape-changes.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&amp;cHash=5abfb28b5e/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010456/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/browse/2/article/nhl-landscape-changes.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&amp;cHash=5abfb28b5e%2F |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated into the NHL game.&lt;ref name="Europe" /&gt;

==Corporate sponsors==
The NHL lists its several official corporate partners into three categories: North American Partners, USA Partners, and Canada Partners.&lt;ref name="NHL.comPartners"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/info/corporate-marketing-partners |title=NHL.com – NHL Corporate Marketing Partners |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Discover Card]] is the league's official credit card in the US, while competitor [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] is an official sponsor in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richard|first1=Sandomir|title=

Among its North American corporate sponsors, [[Kraft Heinz]] sponsors ''[[Kraft Hockeyville]]'', an annual competition in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of [[ice hockey]]. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL pre-season game. Two contests are held, one for communities across Canada and a separate competition for communities in the US.

At least two of the North American corporate sponsors have ties to [[List of NHL franchise owners|NHL franchise owners]]: the [[Molson family]], founders of [[Molson Brewery]], has owned the Montreal Canadiens for years, while [[SAP SE|SAP]] was co-founded by [[Hasso Plattner]], the current majority owner of the San Jose Sharks.

Many of these same corporate partners become the title sponsors for the league's All-Star and [[NHL outdoor games|outdoor games]].

The current national television and digital rightsholder is [[Rogers Communications]], under a 12-year deal valued at [[Canadian dollar|C]]$5.2&amp;nbsp;billion which began in the [[2014–15 NHL season|2014–15 season]], as the national broadcast and cable television rightsholders. National [[NHL on Sportsnet|English-language coverage]] of the NHL is carried primarily by Rogers' [[Sportsnet]] group of specialty channels; Sportsnet holds national windows on Wednesday and Sunday nights. ''Hockey Night in Canada'' was maintained and expanded under the deal, airing up to seven games nationally on Saturday nights throughout the regular season.

{{Main|History of the National Hockey League on United States television}}
[[File:Mike "Doc" Emrick (2014).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mike Emrick|Mike "Doc" Emrick]], NBC Sports lead hockey play-by-play announcer]]
Historically, the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues. The league's American broadcast partners have been in flux for decades, ranging from such networks as [[NHL on CBS|CBS]], [[NHL on SportsChannel America|SportsChannel America]], the [[NHL on USA|USA Network]], [[NHL on Fox|Fox]], [[NHL on ABC|ABC]], and [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]].

National U.S. television rights are currently held by [[NBC Sports]]; its current 10-year, US$2&amp;nbsp;billion contract, which began in the [[2011–12 NHL season|2011–12 season]], extended and unified rights deals that were first established in the 2005–06 season, when [[Comcast]] acquired cable rights to replace ESPN, and [[NBC]] acquired broadcast television rights under a revenue-sharing agreement to replace [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].&lt;ref name="nysun"&gt;{{cite news|first=Evan |last=Weiner |work=New York Sun |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34542 |title= Don't Believe the Gripe: The NHL Is Back |date=June 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC Sports Network]] and the company negotiated a new, 10-year, unified rights deal worth nearly US$2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |title=NBC/Versus To Air NHL Games for the Next Ten Years |author=Fang, Ken |date=April 19, 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018033414/http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |archivedate=October 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this contract, NBCSN usually airs at least two regular season games per week, while NBC airs afternoon games on selected weekends. NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on [[CNBC]], [[USA Network]], [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]].

As in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market, and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them. These broadcasters include [[regional sports network]] chains. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.

===NHL Network===
{{main|NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network (Canada)}}

The league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is ''[[NHL Tonight]]''. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters. 
The U.S. version simulcasts selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.

===Out-of-market packages===
The NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games. [[NHL Centre Ice]] in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=27197 |title=NHL Centre Ice (Canada) official website |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NHL Center Ice]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26371 |title=NHL Center Ice United States official website |website=National Hockey League |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider.

The league also offers ''NHL.tv'' (branded as ''Rogers NHL GameCentre Live'' in Canada), which allows the streaming of out-of-market games over the internet, and has been coordinated by [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]] since 2016. In the United States, NHL.tv does not carry national games or in-market games, while Rogers NHL GameCentre Live does allow those in Canada to stream Sportsnet's national games.

===International===
Outside of Canada and the United States, NHL games are broadcast across Europe, in the Middle East, in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/fox-sports-1/default.htm |title = Fox Sports 1 [501] |publisher = Foxtel.com.au| accessdate =April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Americas across Mexico, Central America, Dominican Republic, Caribbean, South America and Brazil, among others.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

NHL.tv is also available for people outside Canada and the United States to watch games online, but blackout restrictions may still apply if a game is being televised in the user's country. Those in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, where [[Viasat]] holds the NHL rights, must instead stream games from Viasat's [[Viaplay]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/subscribe|title=NHL.tv|publisher=NHL|accessdate=September 26, 2019|quote=For international customers, blackout restrictions may apply to games that appear on an NHL partner network in your viewing area ...

==International competitions==
{{main|List of international games played by NHL teams}}
{{see also|List of international ice hockey competitions featuring NHL players}}
The National Hockey League has occasionally participated in international club competitions. Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in [[Super Series '76|1976]], with eight NHL teams playing against the [[Soviet Championship League]]'s [[HC CSKA Moscow]], and [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow]]. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the [[Super Series]]. No NHL club had played a Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008, when the New York Rangers faced [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] in the [[2008 Victoria Cup]].

In addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced [[HC Kladno|Poldi Kladno]] of the [[Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League]]. In the 2000s the NHL had organized four [[NHL Challenge]] series between NHL, and European clubs. From 2007 to 2011, the NHL organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season, known as the NHL Premiere, between NHL clubs and teams from a number of European leagues. The [[List of international games played by NHL teams#2018 NHL Global Series|2018 NHL Global Series]] was the last NHL-organized club competition involving European teams. NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including an NHL club was the [[2009 Victoria Cup]], between the Swiss [[National League A]]'s [[ZSC Lions]], and the Chicago Blackhawks.

From 1998 to 2014, during the quadrennial [[Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic]] years, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to represent their countries in the Olympic ice hockey tournament; starting 2018, because the All-Star game is held in late January, there would be no Olympic break. Conversely, the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are held every May at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Thus, NHL players generally only join their respective country's team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention, or did not make the playoffs.

In 2007, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) formalized the "[[Triple Gold Club]]", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Winner of three-team tourney to get Victoria Cup|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2863711|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=February 9, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="expands"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple Gold Club expands to 22 |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |website=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218074948/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |archivedate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PR &amp; Media Activities|url=http://www.iihf.com/100-years/100-years-of-ice-hockey/pr-media-activities.html|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had first entered popular use following the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Welcome to the Triple Gold Club: Blake, Sakic, Shanahan: New members to elite club: Olympics, worlds, Stanley Cup|work=[[National Post]]|author=Barnes, Don|date=February 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Triple Gold Club awaits Canadian trio|author=Scanlan, Wayne|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=February 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Skating a fine line|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesColumnistsPreGames/buffery_dec26-sun.html|last=Buffery|first=Steve|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=December 26, 2001|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as participating in the above international club competitions, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association organizes the [[World Cup of Hockey]]. Unlike the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation, the World Cup of Hockey is played under NHL-rules and not those of the IIHF. The tournament takes place prior to the NHL pre-season. The event is planned to be a quadrennial event beginning in 2016.&lt;ref name=sn-wch2016&gt;{{cite web|title=New-look World Cup of hockey back for 2016|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/new-look-world-cup-of-hockey-back-for-2016/|website=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, along with [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]. The league is very prominent in Canada, where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as alongside [[Canadian Football League|CFL]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Press 2006-06-08"&gt;{{Cite news|agency=The Canadian Press |authorlink=Canadian Press |date=June 8, 2006 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060608.wsurvey8/BNStory/Sports/home |title=Survey: Canadian interest in pro football is on the rise |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=June 8, 2006 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues, the smallest revenue from television, and the least sponsorship.&lt;ref name="affluent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml |title=Champions of the Turnstiles |date=August 2004 |last=Markus |first=David |work=gsb.standford.edu |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102214551/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml |archivedate=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL holds one of the most affluent fan bases.&lt;ref name="affluent"/&gt; Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL's fan base is much more affluent than that of the [[PGA Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910221&amp;slug=1267313 |title=Sports: NBA Booming, But Football Is America's Favorite Sport |work=The Seattle Times |date=February 21, 1991 |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}} A study done by the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] in 2004, found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues. Further it noted that season-ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the financial ability of the NHL fan to purchase them.&lt;ref name="affluent" /&gt; According to [[Reuters]] in 2010, the largest demographic of NHL fans was highly sought after group males aged 18–34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6974VM20101008 |title=NHL pushes for growth on TV, online |date=October 8, 2010 |last=Klayman |first=Ben |agency=Reuters|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NHL estimates that half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. Beginning in 2008, the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this.

The debut of the [[NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]], an outdoor regular season NHL game held on [[New Year's Day]] 2008, was a major success for the league. The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national "Game of the Week" and an annual "Hockey Day in America" regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL's regular season television viewership in the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These improvements led NBC and the cable channel [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] to sign a ten-year broadcast deal, paying US$200&amp;nbsp;million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.

This television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL. The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport "after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled in large part by the NHL's strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=531630 Stanley Cup Playoffs attract largest audience ever]", "NHL.com", June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue. Merchandise sales were up 22 percent and the number of unique visitors on the NHL.com website were up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;Klayman, Ben.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6746">This is a list of the longest winning streaks in [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) history. The list includes streaks that started at the end of one season and carried over into the following season. There are two lists, streaks that consist entirely of regular-season games and streaks made up of playoff games only. The [[1992–93 Pittsburgh Penguins season|Pittsburgh Penguins]] hold the record for the longest winning streak in NHL history at 17 games, which was set in the [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93 season]]; that team won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the league's best record of 56–21–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcubed.net/nhl/astrkgwp.shtml|title=NHL: Longest Winning Streaks/Regular Season Games|accessdate=November 7, 2019|work=mcubed.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1991–92 Pittsburgh Penguins season|previous season]], that team won a NHL-record total of 14 straight games in the [[1992 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcubed.net/nhl/astrkgwp.shtml|title=NHL: Longest Winning Streaks/Playoff Games|accessdate=November 7, 2019|work=mcubed.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only regular season winning streaks lasting twelve or more games are included.

The [[Montreal Canadiens]] appear six times across both lists, with four streaks over 11 games in the postseason and two streaks over 12 games or more in the regular season. The [[Boston Bruins]] appear four times across both lists, with three of those streaks over 10 games occurring in the regular season.

Prior to the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], tie games were abolished in favor of a shootout.
