The '''National Basketball Association''' ('''NBA''') is a men's [[professional basketball]] [[sports league|league]] in [[North America]], composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is one of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]], and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.

The league was founded in [[New York City]] on June 6, 1946, as the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA).&lt;ref name="ANewLeagueNBA.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldaper|first=Sam|title=The First Game|url=http://www.nba.com/history/firstgame_feature.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL). The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. Its playoffs extend into June. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportingIntelligence.com |title=REVEALED: The world's best paid teams, Man City close in on Barca and Real Madrid |url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2012/05/01/revealed-the-worlds-best-paid-teams-man-city-close-in-on-barca-and-real-madrid-010501/ |date=May 1, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaines|first1=Cork|title=The NBA is the highest-paying sports league in the world|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sports-leagues-top-salaries-2015-5|website=Business Insider|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA is an active member of [[USA Basketball]] (USAB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of USA Basketball|url=http://www.usab.com/about/inside-usa-basketball/members.aspx|publisher=[[USA Basketball]]|date=June 28, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630155528/http://www.usab.com/about/inside-usa-basketball/members.aspx|archivedate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is recognized by [[FIBA]] (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the [[Sport governing body|national governing body]] for basketball in the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in [[Midtown Manhattan]], while its [[NBA Entertainment]] and [[NBA TV]] studios are directed out of offices located in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]].

==History==

===Creation and BAA–NBL merger (1946–1956)===
{{Main|Basketball Association of America}}
The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major [[ice hockey]] arenas in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, the [[Toronto Huskies]] hosted the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.&lt;ref name="firstgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Basketball in Canada|url=http://www.nba.com/canada/History_of_Basketball_in_Canad-Canada_Generic_Article-18023.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=March 8, 2002|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first basket was made by [[Ossie Schectman]] of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]] and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist [[Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)|Baltimore Bullets]] moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia|publisher=Villard Books|date=1994|page=34|isbn=0-679-43293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams–Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo–merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including [[Maurice Podoloff]] as president.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.

The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nba-is-born |title=NBA is born |work=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the [[New York Knicks]], [[Boston Celtics]], [[Philadelphia Warriors]], [[Minneapolis Lakers]], [[Rochester Royals]], [[Fort Wayne Pistons]], [[Tri-Cities Blackhawks]], and [[Syracuse Nationals]], all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] to [[Milwaukee]] in 1951, and then to [[St. Louis]] in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from [[Rochester, New York]], to [[Cincinnati]] in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], to [[Detroit]] in 1957.

[[Japanese-American]] [[Wataru Misaka]] broke the [[NBA color barrier]] in the [[1947–48 NBA season|1947–48 season]] when he played for the [[New York Knicks]]. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, [[Harold Hunter (basketball)|Harold Hunter]], signing with the [[Washington Capitols]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=kcstar&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam |last=McDowell |title=Sumner grad Harold Hunter, first African-American to sign with NBA team, dies at 86 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/03/08/4109211/sumner-grad-harold-hunter-first.html |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=March 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312014711/http://www.kansascity.com/2013/03/08/4109211/sumner-grad-harold-hunter-first.html |archivedate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timespicayune&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA pioneer Harold Hunter, an ex-Xavier coach, died Thursday |url=http://www.nola.com/xavier/index.ssf/2013/03/pioneering_coach_harold_hunter.html|work=[[Times-Picayune]]|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,&lt;ref name=kcstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=citypaper&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Tennessee State basketball coach Harold Hunter dies|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/former-tennessee-state-basketball-coach-harold-hunter-dies|work=[[The City Paper]]|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102164059/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/former-tennessee-state-basketball-coach-harold-hunter-dies|archivedate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] with the Celtics, [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton]] with the Knicks, and [[Earl Lloyd]] with the [[Washington Capitols]]. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center [[George Mikan]], won five [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]] and established themselves as the league's first [[Dynasty (sports)|dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1949–51: Lakers Win First NBA Finals|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html#4|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Lakers.com|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second [[shot clock]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Rules History|url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=May 8, 2008|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.

===Celtics' dominance, league expansion and competition (1956–1979)===
In 1957, rookie center [[Bill Russell]] joined the [[Boston Celtics]], which already featured guard [[Bob Cousy]] and coach [[Red Auerbach]], and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring ([[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100]]) and rebounding (55). [[Russell–Chamberlain rivalry|Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain]] became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.

[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bill Russell]] defending against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in 1966.]]

The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in [[1966–67 NBA season|1966–67]], but regained it in the [[1967–68 NBA season|1967–68 season]] and repeated in [[1968–69 NBA season|1969]]. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Championship Wins|url=https://www.nba.com/celtics/history/championships|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Celtics.com|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the [[Minneapolis Lakers]] to Los Angeles, the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] to San Francisco, the [[Syracuse Nationals]] to [[Philadelphia]] to become the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and the [[St. Louis Hawks]] moving to [[Atlanta]], as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now [[Washington Wizards]]) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (now [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]), [[San Diego Rockets]] (who relocated to [[Houston]] four years later), [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and [[Phoenix Suns]].

In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, [[Rick Barry]], jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees—[[Norm Drucker]], [[Earl Strom]], John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzberg|first=Charles|title=From Set Shot to Slam Dunk|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8032-9250-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Alan Siegel]], who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's [[Major League Baseball logo]] a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary [[Jerry West]] based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, "They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player." The iconic logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=That iconic NBA silhouette can be traced back to him|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/27/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100427|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://companylogos.ws/nbalogo.html NBA Logo Review] CompanyLogos.ws. Retrieved May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including [[Julius Erving]] of the [[Virginia Squires]], in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and [[Buffalo Braves]] (now the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1970–71 SEASON OVERVIEW|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19701971.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Orleans Jazz (now in [[Utah Jazz|Utah]]) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a [[ABA–NBA merger|settlement]] that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[New York Nets]] (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Rick Barry]], [[Dave Cowens]], [[Julius Erving]], [[Elvin Hayes]], [[Walt Frazier]], [[Moses Malone]], [[Artis Gilmore]], [[George Gervin]], [[Dan Issel]], and [[Pete Maravich]]. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the league.

===Surging popularity (1979–1998)===
The league added the ABA's [[three-point field goal]] beginning in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1979/10/11/new-twist-in-nba-the-3-point-goal/e5547a77-ec79-491c-af8e-b09966d893a6/|title=New Twist in NBA: the 3-Point Goal|last=DuPree|first=David|date=11 October 1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, rookies [[Larry Bird]] and [[Magic Johnson]] joined the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/endofcentury/s/century/katz.html|title=ESPN.com - ENDOFCENTURY - Katz: Magic and Bird did it all|website=www.espn.com|access-date=2019-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had faced each other in the [[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game]], and they later played against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/la-lakers-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-greatest-moments-magic-johnson-kobe-bryant-shaq-oneal-phil-jackson-jerry-buss-062217|title=The 12 defining moments in Lakers history|last=ET|first=2017 at 9:17p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bird led the Celtics to three titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-13-sp-856-story.html|title=Bird's Salary Projected at $6 Million in '91-'92|date=1989-08-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the [[Dallas Mavericks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-11-08-ss-374-story.html|title=NBA: A Season Begins : Price of a Starting NBA Franchise Is Up to $32.5 Million|date=1988-11-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the total to 23 teams.

===Lakers' and Spurs' dynasties (1998–2014)===
Since the breakup of the [[Chicago Bulls]] championship roster in the summer of 1998, the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] has dominated. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of coach [[Phil Jackson]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] of [[Gregg Popovich]] combined to make 13 Finals in 16 seasons, with 10 titles. [[Tim Duncan]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] won the [[1999 NBA Finals|1999 championship]] with the [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]] started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]] against the [[New Jersey Nets|Nets]]. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the [[2004 NBA Finals|Finals]], only to lose in five games to the [[Detroit Pistons]].

The league's image was marred by a [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|violent incident between players and fans]] in a November 2004 game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]]. In response, players were suspended for a total of 146 games with $11 million total lost in salary, and the league tightened security and limited the sale of alcohol.

After the Spurs took home the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] in [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], the [[2006 NBA Finals|2006 Finals]] featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The [[Miami Heat]], led by their star shooting guard, [[Dwyane Wade]], and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during summer 2004, won the series over the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], who were led by [[LeBron James]]. The [[2008 NBA Finals|2008 Finals]] saw a rematch of the league's [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|highest profile rivalry]], the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]], with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of [[Paul Pierce]], [[Ray Allen]], and [[Kevin Garnett]].

In 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the [[2009 NBA Finals|Finals]], this time defeating the [[Dwight Howard]]-led [[2008–09 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. Bryant won his first [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2009061419&amp;prov=ap |title=Redemption: Bryant leads Lakers to 15th NBA title|last1=Withers|first1=Tom|date=June 15, 2009|work=[[Yahoo!

Two free agents signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and [[Chris Bosh]], did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]] (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans [[Shawn Marion]], [[Jason Kidd]], [[Jason Terry]], and [[Peja Stojaković]] celebrated their first NBA championship.

On July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced [[2011 NBA lockout|another lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Stein | authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) | title=NBA cancels first 2 weeks of season | date=October 11, 2011 | url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7085089/nba-labor-david-stern-cancels-first-two-weeks-nba-season | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/sports/basketball/nba-owners-and-players-ratify-labor-deal.html|title=N.B.A. Owners and Players Ratify Labor Deal|date=December 9, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh against [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]'s [[Kevin Durant]], [[Russell Westbrook]], and [[James Harden]]. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the [[2013 NBA Finals]]. The two teams would meet for a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the Heat in five games. Off the court, commissioner David Stern retired on February 1, 2014, exactly 30 years to the day from taking office. He was succeeded by his deputy, [[Adam Silver]].

===Modern era (2014–present)===
Following the 2014 Finals, LeBron James announced that he would return to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. James led the Cavaliers to their second Finals appearance, where they lost to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in six games. The following year, in a rematch, the [[2016 NBA Finals]] concluded with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first NBA Championship. The [[Cavaliers–Warriors rivalry|dominance of those two teams]] continued in 2017, when the Warriors, having signed Kevin Durant as a free agent, took the third straight Finals matchup between the two teams in five games, with Durant named Finals MVP, and again in 2018 when they went to a fourth straight Finals matchup.

During free agency in 2018, LeBron James signed with the Lakers. In the following season, the Warriors returned to the Finals for the fifth straight year, where they were defeated by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in six games.

===International influence===
{{Further|List of foreign NBA players}}

Following pioneers like [[Vlade Divac]] ([[Serbia]]) and [[Dražen Petrović]] ([[Croatia]]) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced [[EuroLeague]] teams [[NBA vs. EuroLeague games|in exhibition matches]] in the [[NBA Europe Live Tour]], and since 2009, in the [[EuroLeague American Tour]]. The [[2013–14 NBA season|2013–14 season]] opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2013/10/29/record-92-foreign-players-on-nba-rosters-to-start-season/|title=Record 92 foreign players on NBA rosters to start season|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the 2017-18 season saw a record 108 international players representing 42 different countries marking 4 consecutive years of at least 100 international players and each team having at least one international player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NBA rosters feature 108 international players from record 42 countries and territories|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/17/nba-international-players-2017-18-season-record-countries|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=October 17, 2017|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Phoenix Suns]] hired Serbian coach [[Igor Kokoškov]] as their new head coach, replacing Canadian interim coach [[Jay Triano]], making Kokoškov the first European coach to become a head coach for a team in the NBA.

===Other developments===
In 2001, an affiliated [[minor league]], the National Basketball Development League, now called the [[NBA G League]], was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: NBA G League|url=https://gleague.nba.com/faq/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=GLeague.NBA.com|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the [[Continental Basketball Association]], and call it its developmental league.

Two years after the Hornets' relocation to [[New Orleans]], the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]] were formed as an [[expansion team]] in 2004.&lt;!--The NBA officially considers the Bobcats as part of the current Hornets' history.--&gt;

The Hornets [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|temporarily relocated]] to [[Oklahoma City]] in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.

A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA Introduces New Game Ball|url=http://www.nba.com/news/blackbox_060628.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=June 28, 2006|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]], the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.

Commissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2694335 |last=Stein |first=Marc |title=Leather ball will return on Jan. 1 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 12, 2006 |authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NBA Players Association|Players' Association]] had filed a suit on behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;id=2689744 |title=NBA ball controversy reaches new level |last=Stein |first=Marc |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 8, 2006 |authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2017–18 season, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], replacing the previous supplier, [[Adidas]].

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee [[Tim Donaghy]] bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the [[point spread]] in those games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095 Donaghy under investigation for betting on NBA games], [[ESPN]]. July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain referees were friendly with players and "company men" for the NBA, and he alleged that referees influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a "singing, cooperating witness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2002 Lakers-Kings Game 6 at heart of Donaghy allegations |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401 |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Virgin |first=Ryan |title=David Stern and Tim Donaghy's Motives Are Not That Different

The [[2011–12 NBA season]], scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was [[2011 NBA lockout|postponed due to a labor dispute]]. The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.

After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets were renamed the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Orleans Pelicans Officially Adopt New Namesake|url=http://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/new-orleans-pelicans-officially-adopt-new-namesake|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Pelicans.com|date=April 18, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner [[Adam Silver]] ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.&lt;ref name=hornets_name_returns&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]].)

[[Donald Sterling]], who was then-owner of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clippers owner Sterling banned for life by the NBA|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/04/29/nba-bans-donald-sterling.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Becky Hammon]] was hired by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs make WNBA's Hammon first female NBA assistant|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/08/05/spurs-becky-hammon.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=borntocoach&gt;{{cite news|last=Fagan|first=Kate|title=Becky Hammon was born to coach|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/11313239/wnba-san-antonio-stars-future-spurs-assistant-becky-hammon-was-born-coach|publisher=ESPN|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports]] in North America.&lt;ref name=borntocoach/&gt;

The NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its teams to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s logo, marking the first time a manufacturer's logo would appear on NBA jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA would become the first [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports league]] to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms, and the last to have a uniform manufacturer logo appear on its team uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Brian|title=NBA to begin selling jersey sponsorships in 2017-18|url=http://www.nba.com/2016/news/04/15/nba-to-begin-selling-jersey-sponsorships-in-2017-18.ap/index.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], who agreed to a deal with [[StubHub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Philadelphia 76ers And StubHub Announce First Jersey Sponsorship In Major American Professional Sports|url=http://www.nba.com/sixers/philadelphia-76ers-and-stubhub-announce-first-jersey-sponsorship-major-american-professional-sports|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Sixers.com|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it is largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a "richer" color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the [[2017 NBA Summer League]], but it will not immediately be used on equipment or uniforms due to [[lead time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A first look at the NBA's refreshed logo|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/06/first-look-nbas-refreshed-logo-2017-18-season|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA also officially released new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] uniforms for all 30 teams beginning with the 2017–18 season. The league eliminated "home" and "away" uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four or six uniforms: the "Association" edition, which is the team's white uniform, the "Icon" edition, which is the team's color uniform, and two other uniform editions, to be unveiled at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Lang|title=NBA, Nike unveil new uniforms for 2017-18 season|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/18/nba-nike-new-uniforms#/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=July 18, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NBA labeled map|float=right}}
{{geoGroup|float=left}}

The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.

The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]]. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the [[Eastern Time Zone]], nine in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]], three in the [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], and five in the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]].

==Regular season==
Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the [[NBA G League]]. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.

During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the [[strength of schedule]] will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).

The NBA is one of only two of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the [[National Hockey League]]). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.

The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on [[Christmas]] Day.&lt;ref name=Christmas&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuhmann|first=John|title=Knicks, Kobe and more part of Christmas Day lore|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/john_schuhmann/12/17/numbers.christmas/index.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=December 17, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league has been playing [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|games]] regularly on the holiday since 1947,&lt;ref name=ChristmasMatchups&gt;{{cite news|title=Christmas Tradition|newspaper=The Riverside (Ca.)

In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual [[NBA All-Star Game]]. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the [[Internet]], and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|Game MVP award]]. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the [[Rising Stars Challenge]] (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the [[Skills Challenge]], where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the [[Three Point Contest]], where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.

Shortly after the All-Star break is the [[trade deadline]], which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Trading Deadline Trades Since 1987|url=http://www.nba.com/history/deadline_deals.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.

Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|Sixth Man of the Year Award]] is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year Award]] is awarded to the league's best defender. The [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]] is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, ''[[Sporting News]]'' awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year Award]] to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.

The post-season teams are the [[All-NBA Team]], the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Team]], and the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie Team]]; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Playoffs==
{{Main|NBA playoffs}}
The NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).

Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006–07 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the sixth seed had a better record than the team with the third seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the sixth seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the [[Denver Nuggets]] won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the third seed. Their opponent was the sixth-seeded [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.

The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the [[NBA Finals]] followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2–2–1–1–1|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the [[NBA Finals]], and is held annually in June. The winner of the NBA Finals receives the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] to the best performing player of the series.

The league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015–16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA to seed playoff teams in each conference by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-playoff-seeding-change-ap.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
{{Main|National Basketball Association on television}}
{{See also|List of current National Basketball Association broadcasters}}
As one of the major sports leagues in North America, the NBA has a long history of partnerships with television networks in the United States. The NBA signed a contract with [[DuMont Television Network]] in its eighth season, the [[1953-54 NBA season|1953–54 season]], marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to the [[National Football League]], the lack of television stations led to [[NBC]] taking over the rights from the [[1954-55 NBA season|1954-55 season]] until April 7, 1962–NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with [[ESPN]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] through the 2024–25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over [[regional sports network]]s specific to the area where the teams are located.

==International competitions==
The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the [[FIBA|Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA)]] in the [[McDonald's Championship]]. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=3754278 |title=New club basketball championship to debut in 2010 |date=December 9, 2008 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticket prices and viewership demographics==
In 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors= |date=January 2013 |title= |journal=[[Reader's Digest]] |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewership demographics===
According to Nielsen's survey, in 2013 the NBA had the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with [[Major League Baseball]], to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest share of [[African Americans|black]] viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being [[White American|white]], making it the only top North American sport that does not have a white majority audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/|title=Which Sports Have the Whitest/Richest/Oldest Fans?|first=Derek|last=Thompson|date=February 10, 2014|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the NBA's popularity further declined among White Americans, who during the 2016–17 season, only made up 34% of the viewership. At the same time, the black viewership increased to 47 percent, while Hispanic (of any race) stood at 11 percent and Asian viewership stood at 8 percent. According to the same poll, the NBA was favored more strongly by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] than [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://morningconsult.com/2018/01/25/nfl-isnt-divisive-sport-america/|title=The NFL Isn't the Only Divisive Sport in America|last=Piacenza|first=Joanna|date=January 25, 2018|publisher=Morning Consult}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following pioneers like [[Vlade Divac]] ([[Serbia]]) and [[Dražen Petrović]] ([[Croatia]]) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA.

Since 2006, the NBA has faced [[EuroLeague]] teams [[EuroLeague vs. NBA games|in exhibition matches]] in the [[NBA Europe Live Tour]], and since 2009 in the [[EuroLeague American Tour]].
