The '''NBA Store''' is a chain of officially licensed [[retailers]] which sell [[merchandise]] for the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The most prominent of these stores is located in the [[United States]] on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[45th Street (Manhattan)|45th Street]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. There are seven other locations outside the United States: one in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], two in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], one in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], and three in the [[Metro Manila]]; the newest store in [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]].

The New York location is run by online retailer ''[[Fanatics, Inc.|Fanatics]]'', who also runs the League's online store at [[NBAStore.com]]. The NBA Store sells over 35,000 pieces of NBA merchandise&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rovell|first1=Darren|title=Fanatics, NBA open new 25K-square-foot store on Fifth Avenue|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14414753/nba-opens-new-25000-square-foot-store-manhattan|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features several attractions; it is often visited by players, celebrities, and political leaders. It also serves as a headquarters for the NBA where the association hosts charity events.

Since opening its first store in 1998, the NBA has seen increasing business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to the influx of new [[National Basketball Association|international players]]. The biggest growth has been in China, where players [[Yao Ming]] and [[Yi Jianlian]], combined with the interest generated by the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like [[Second Life]] where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.

The original Fifth Avenue store closed on February 13, 2011. The league temporarily relocated the store in a smaller space at 590 Fifth Avenue until August 2015. The new location, at 545 Fifth Avenue, opened on December 21, 2015.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

In [[2006–07 NBA season|2007]], the most sold team paraphernalia were from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], New York Knicks, and the [[2006 NBA Finals|2006 NBA champions]] the [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref name="JRankings07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/news/popularjerseys_070611.html|title=Lakers' Bryant Ends Season Atop NBA's Most Popular Jersey List|last=NBA Staff|date=2007-07-11|work=News|publisher=NBA|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Lakers and Knicks retained their top spots, but the Heat were replaced by the new [[2008 NBA Finals|2008 NBA champions]] the [[Boston Celtics]].&lt;ref name="JRankings08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/news/jersey_list_080613.html|title=Kevin Garnett's Jersey Tops Bestseller List|last=NBA Staff|date=2008-06-13|work=News|publisher=NBA|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA Store's main outlet in New York City was closed on February 13, 2011, due to high rent. "The amount of dollars the landlord is requiring from the next tenant, we couldn't find a way to make it work," NBA executive vice president of global merchandising Sal LaRocca said. While the league searched for a new location &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High rent prompts NBA to plan N.Y. store closing|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/story/14268896/high-rent-prompts-nba-to-plan-ny-store-closing|publisher=CBS Sports|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Store closing Sunday; new NYC location in works|url=http://www.nba.com/2011/news/02/11/nba-store-closing.ap/index.html|publisher=NBA|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the store operated temporarily at 590 Fifth Avenue until August 2015.

The NBA also sells its products outside the United States, most notably in China. The NBA's international operations only provide 10 percent of total profit; however, the NBA has seen a recent increase in possible business opportunities abroad.&lt;ref name="FirstChina" /&gt;

Statistics revealed that 300 million out of China's 1.3 billion population played basketball, additionally "83 percent of males between 15 to 61 years old are interested in the game," and the NBA was reported to be "the most popular sports league in the country."&lt;ref name="FirstChina" /&gt;
In 2006, it was reported that the NBA was planning to open its first store in [[Beijing|Beijing, China]] (on [[Wangfujing Street]]) or [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]].&lt;ref name="FirstChina"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA To Open First Overseas Store In China |last= |date=2006-11-19|publisher=Asia Pulse via COMTEX|id=(Record Number - [[NewsBank]] : 86272804)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Partly due to [[Yao Ming]] ([[List of first overall NBA draft picks|1st overall pick]] in [[2002 NBA Draft|2002]]) and [[Yi Jianlian]]'s (6th overall pick in [[2007 NBA Draft|2007]]) popularity in their home country, the NBA now sells its products in some 30,000 to 50,000 retail locations in China.&lt;ref name="YiChina"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yi jersey supply limited: Rookie's late signing held up production|last=Walker|first=Don|date=2007-11-16|work=Article|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]], The (WI)|id=(Accession Number - [[EBSCO]] : 2W62W6755644466)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesChina"&gt;{{cite news|title=N.B.A. and Partner to Help Build 12 Arenas in China |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=2008-10-12|publisher=[[New York Times]], The (NY) |id=([[NewsBank]] - Record Number: 2008-10-12-066435)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006 season the NBA broadcast its games in 215 countries and had 83 foreign players, about a quarter of the total players.&lt;ref name="FullCourtPress"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/managing/2006/11/13/leadership-basketball-sports-lead-manage-cx_tvr_1113nba.html |title=The NBA's Global Full Court Press |last=Van Riper |first=Tom |date=2006-11-16 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2008-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312163447/http://www.forbes.com/managing/2006/11/13/leadership-basketball-sports-lead-manage-cx_tvr_1113nba.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it had 75 players from 32 different countries.&lt;ref name="ForeignNBA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/players/int_players_0809.html|title=NBA Players From Around The World: 2008-09 Season|last=NBA Staff|date=2008-11-03|work=NBA Website|publisher=NBA|accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NBA Nation''' is a touring property operated by the [[National Basketball Association]] through its subsidiary, [[NBA Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5525113|title=NBA Entertainment, Inc.: Private Company Information|work=Business Week|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour appears alongside local events across the United States during the spring and summer and features a variety of NBA-themed events and programs, such as skills contests and fitness clinics. The tour also addresses social issues in the host cities as part of the league's outreach program.

==History==
In 2001, the NBA launched NBA Rhythm ’n Rims as a traveling basketball and music event in partnership with [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release754.html|title=NBA and Yahoo!

The tour's itinerary changes each year. According to the NBA's Director of Events and Attractions, Karen Barberan, "Routing the NBA Nation tour year after year is a challenge, as we are constantly balancing efforts to hit well-attended events and festivals in key NBA markets, while satisfying the marketing targets of our tour [brand] partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediapost.com/blogs/raw/?p=2294|title=NBA Nation Tour Gets Local/National Marketing Push|author=Karl Greenberg|work=Marketing Daily|date=2010-04-28|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a given year, over one million people across the U.S. will visit one of the tour stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitchengine.com/nbanationtour/nba-nation-presented-by-tmobile--kia-motors-tips-off-an--eightcity-tour-beginning-may-1/59061/|title=NBA NATION PRESENTED BY T-MOBILE &amp; KIA MOTORS TIPS OFF AN EIGHT-CITY TOUR BEGINNING MAY 1|work=PitchEngine.com|date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">'''Player tracking''' refers to technologies used to track players and the ball (if applicable) in various sports.  The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) first tracked all games at the start of the [[2013–14 NBA season|2013-14 NBA season]].&lt;ref&gt;nba.com. [http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2013/10/09/hang-time-podcast-episode-133-the-schuhmann-stat/ Hangtime Podcast (episode 133)]. Accessed 2 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  [https://secondspectrum.com Second Spectrum] is the current Official Optical Tracking Provider of the NBA and began league-wide tracking in the [[2017-18 NBA season]], replacing [https://www.stats.com/sportvu-basketball/ STATS SportVU] which previously held the league-wide contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pr.nba.com/nba-announces-multiyear-partnership-sportradar-second-spectrum/|title=NBA announces multiyear partnership with Sportradar and Second Spectrum|date=2016-09-22|website=NBA.com: NBA Communications|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Technology ==

The NBA (via [https://secondspectrum.com Second Spectrum]) uses an optical tracking system that leverages multiple cameras  placed in the [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalks]] in all [[NBA arenas|29 NBA arenas]].  The cameras receive and update data at a rate of 25 frames per second.  The cameras feed the data into [[proprietary software]], where computer vision algorithms extract positional data for all players on the court and the ball.  

== Statistics  ==

The NBA provides a variety of statistics to the public based on the data produced by player tracking to the public on its website.  This includes information for players covering categories such as drives, defensive impact, catch and shoot, passing, touches, pull up shooting, rebounding, shooting efficiency, speed, and post ups among others. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting-efficiency/?dir=1&amp;sort=POINTS|title=Players Shooting Efficiency|website=NBA Stats|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar information is available for teams.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stats.nba.com/teams/drives/|title=Teams Drives|website=NBA Stats|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition, more sophisticated and detailed tools are available to teams and broadcasters that are not currently available to the public. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fansided.com/2018/06/28/second-spectrum-redesigning-nba/|title=Nylon Calculus: How Second Spectrum is redesigning the NBA|date=2018-06-28|website=FanSided|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Player tracking systems introduce many new statistics, automate the collection of data and provide precision which would be impossible without the use of camera technology and tracking software.

Statistics collected, and available to view during the game and throughout the season include (all statistics are per player):&lt;ref&gt;stats.nba.com. "[http://stats.nba.com/playerTracking.html Player Tracking]", Accessed 2 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

* Rebounding opportunities (rebounds collected "within a 3.5-foot vicinity") - rebound chances per game, percentage of available rebounds grabbed, total rebounds.
* Drives (defined as "any touch that starts at least 20 feet of the hoop and is dribbled within 10 feet of the hoop, excluding fast breaks") - points per game on drives, team points per game on drives, total player points on drives.

'''James F. Goldstein''' (born January 5, 1940) is an American millionaire "NBA superfan", who attends over one hundred [[NBA]] games each season typically in courtside seats, including approximately 95 percent of home games for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].

He also travels from city to city to catch games, especially during the NBA playoffs (and not necessarily Lakers and Clippers playoff games). He also frequently attends post-game press conferences. His unique and flamboyant clothing makes him fairly easy to spot on television.  His passion for the NBA has been featured in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', and ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]''.

"He has so much invested in our sport," Former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] said. "He probably has the largest investment of any fan in America, so we get a kick out of him. He has got quite a flair, and we love him as a sort of a superfan."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Biography==
The son of Nanette (née Gamse) and Milwaukee department store owner, C. Ellis Goldstein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-01-10/news/0501100370_1_nanette-rice-beloved Baltimore Sun: "Rice, Nanette"] January 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marycumminsrealestatemarycummins.blogspot.com/2016/06/who-is-james-f-goldstein-nba-super-fan.html Mary Cummins Real Estate: "Who is James F Goldstein NBA super fan and owner of Sheats Goldstein Residence in Los Angeles, California?"] June 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein said he began watching NBA games as a 10-year-old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chris Warren, ''Superfan'', American Way Magazine, February 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 15 he was hired to keep game statistics by the Milwaukee Hawks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Once I did that and sat courtside for the games, I was totally hooked", he said. "My entire life has been devoted to professional basketball since then. I have such a passion for the game. I think there's more athleticism displayed in basketball than in any other sport."&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005"&gt;Bob Young, ''Hat's Off to NBA's No. 1 Fan'', Boston Globe, May 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldstein graduated from [[Nicolet High School]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] where he played on the basketball team.  He then attended [[Stanford University]] and has remained in [[California]] ever since.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steele |first=Ben |url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/meet-jim-goldstein-milwaukee-native-is-nbas-no-1-fan-uh5njo1-158384505.html |title=Milwaukee native is NBA's No. 1 fan |website=Jsonline.com |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having attended over 2,000 games, Goldstein befriended several current and former NBA players, including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Sam Cassell]], and [[Dennis Rodman]].

Unlike some other "super fans" however, Goldstein is content to simply observe the games and enjoy them, without yelling at referees or taunting players. He claims to have no favorite team, in spite of his Lakers and Clippers season tickets. He describes himself as a fan of the NBA in general.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Sansevere, ''Wolves have at least 1 L.A. fan'', St. Paul Pioneer-Press, May 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein refuses to disclose how he made his fortune or his net worth, although the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' speculated that Goldstein made [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] in real estate (notably [[Century City]] in Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Gurewitsch, ''On the Path to Illumination'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, he typically responds, "Let's just say I had some investments that worked out pretty well." "I try not to think about the cost," he said. "It's worth it to me."&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005" /&gt;

He has never married, nor has had any children. He has stated that he doesn't believe in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsh|first1=Steve|title=Legends of NBA Style: The GQ+A With Superfan Jimmy Goldstein|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nba-fashion-style-jimmy-goldstein-interview|website=GQ|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwin|first1=Bruce|title=Jim Goldstein – Living the American Dream|url=https://newsblaze.com/business/latest-business/jim-goldstein-living-american-dream_32746/|website=NewsBlaze|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residence==
Goldstein's house,  known as [[Sheats Goldstein Residence]], has been featured in ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', DOLCE magazine, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Robb Report]], and ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]''. The house was designed  in 1963 by [[John Lautner]], a student of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Goldstein purchased the property in the 1970s from previous owners who did not keep the house in good condition. Goldstein commissioned Lautner to make changes and improvements to the house. Below the main residence is an installation by light artist [[James Turrell]] known as "Skyspace" or "Sky Box".&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005"/&gt;

Goldstein worked closely with Lautner and Duncan Nicholson, who took over after Lautner's death in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021005084906/http://www.nicholsonwirts.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson is now chief architect. "I wanted to remake the house exactly as John [Lautner] would have wanted it, and to introduce technology that didn't exist 30 years ago", Goldstein explained. The property next door to his also had a Lautner designed house on it, which Goldstein bought and tore down to build a party house, tennis court and office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiland |first=Elijah |url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2012/07/the_lautner_house_torn_down_to_expand_a_lautner_house.php |title=The Lautner House Torn Down to Expand a Lautner House - Curbed LA |website=La.curbed.com |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  continues to make improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020606040313/http://www.jamesfgoldstein.com/architecture_moderismreborn.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Goldstein promised that the house eventually will become the property of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiland |first=Elijah |url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2016/02/sheats-goldstein_house_lacma_history_photos.php |title=A Complete Guide to LACMA's First Piece of Architecture, the Most Spectacular House in Los Angeles - Curbed LA |website=La.curbed.com |date=2016-02-17 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residence has also been featured in a number of movies, including ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'', ''French Exit'', and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.

In basketball, [[Point (basketball)|points]] are used to keep track of the score in a game. Points can be accumulated by making [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]]s (worth two points from within the three-point line or [[three-point field goal|three points]] from beyond the three-point line) or [[free throw]]s (worth one point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/baskBasi/glos.asp|title=Basketball glossary|work=FIBA.com|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game's winner. If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play, additional [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] period(s) are played in order to determine the winner.

Teams only averaged around 80 points per game in the years following the founding of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) in 1946.&lt;ref name="league avg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html|title=NBA League Averages|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the introduction of the [[shot clock]], teams often [[running out the clock|ran out the clock]] by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable.&lt;ref name="shot clock"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/sports/basketball/25clock.html|title = In 1954, Shot Clock Revived a Stalled N.B.A.|work =The New York Times|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=December 25, 2004|first=Richard|last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the [[1954–55 NBA season|1954–55 season]], the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the [[basketball rim|rim]] with the ball within the allotted time, they would lose possession.&lt;ref name="shot clock 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Shot Clock|url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|date=October 22, 2001|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/651DP4PzV?url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html|archive-date=2012-01-28|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games.&lt;ref name="shot clock 2"/&gt; All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.

==Summary==
The highest-scoring regular season game is the triple-overtime game between the [[Detroit Pistons]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]] on December 13, 1983. The two teams combined to score 370 points, with the Pistons defeating the Nuggets 186–184. An NBA-record four players scored over 40 points in the game, including the Nuggets' [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] with a game-high 51. The two teams also set several other NBA records, including the most points scored by one team (186 points), the most points scored by a losing team (184), the most field goals by two teams (142), most field goals by one team (74) and most [[assist (basketball)|assist]]s by two teams (93).&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell|first=John|title=Highest Scoring Game Ever|url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/highest_score_071211.html|accessdate=March 22, 2013|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=neel/051213|title = The big score|work =ESPN.com|accessdate=March 29, 2013|date=December 13, 2005|first=Eric|last=Neel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest-scoring regular season game in regulation was between the [[Golden State Warriors]] and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. In that game, Golden State defeated Denver 162–158. The Warriors' [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] scored a game-high 38 points. The Nuggets were coached by [[Doug Moe]] from 1980 to 1990 and [[Paul Westhead]] from 1990 to 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/moedo01c.html|title=Doug Moe|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/westhpa99c.html|title=Paul Westhead|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom employed a [[Run and gun (basketball)|run and gun]] offensive strategy, which focuses on attempting a high number of field goals while also conceding a large number of points on defense.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{cite news |last=Newman |first=Bruce |title=This Joker Is Wild |date=November 7, 1988 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=The+Nuggets%27+Doug+Moe%2C+the+NBA+Coach+of+the+Year%2C+-+11.07.88+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=415797067&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1067962%2Findex.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYBwiLvY?url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=The%20Nuggets%27%20Doug%20Moe%2C%20the%20NBA%20Coach%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20-%2011.07.88%20-%20SI%20Vault&amp;urlID=415797067&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn. |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ira |last=Berkow |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/15/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-nutty-numbers-for-the-nuggets.html |title=The Nutty Numbers for The Nuggets |work=The New York Times|date=November 15, 1990 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Moe's and Westhead's Nuggets were participants in six of the fourteen highest-scoring regular season games in NBA history. The Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]] from 1988 to 1995 and 2006 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/nelsodo01c.html|title=Don Nelson|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed [[Nellie Ball]], a style of run and gun that uses smaller, more athletic players to outrun opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lee |last=Jenkins |title=Nellie Ball Energizes Warriors and Confounds Opponents |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/sports/basketball/13warriors.html |work=The New York Times |date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable high scoring regular season game is a March 2, 1962 game between the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. In that game, the Warriors' [[Wilt Chamberlain]] scored an NBA-record [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100 points]].&lt;ref name="wilt"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/sports/basketball/50th-anniversary-of-a-scoring-feat-thats-as-much-legend-as-record.html |title =50th Anniversary of a Scoring Feat That's as Much Legend as Record|work =The New York Times|accessdate=May 3, 2013|date=March 1, 2012|first=Richard|last=Sandomir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest-scoring [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] game is the double-overtime game between the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]] on May 11, 1992. The two teams combined to score 304 points, with the Trail Blazers defeating the Suns 153–151. The Suns' [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] scored a game-high 35 points, with 12 other players also scoring in double figures.  The highest-scoring playoff game in regulation occurred when the [[San Antonio Spurs]] defeated the [[Denver Nuggets]] with a score of 152–133 for a combined score of 285 points on April 26, 1983. In that game, the Spurs' [[George Gervin]] scored a game-high 42 points.

Most of the highest-scoring games happened before the [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 season]], when the average scoring (points per game) per team was always in the 100s.&lt;ref name="league avg"/&gt; Until the emergence of 'small ball' in 2013, the average had dropped down to the 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bothamley|first=Dylan|author2=Levin, Max |title=Fastbreaks: Back to the Future|url=http://www.82games.com/levbot.htm|publisher=82games.com|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]] and a December 7, 2006 game between the [[Phoenix Suns]] and [[New Jersey Nets]]. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and [[Mike D'Antoni]] respectively, both of whom also made use of the run and gun style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Howard |last=Beck |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/sports/basketball/13knicks.html |title=Want to Play for D’Antoni? Start Running |work=The New York Times|date=May 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2019 season saw an entry into this list with a 4 overtime game between the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]]. Interestingly, [[Vince Carter]] played in both the 2019 and 2006 contests.

The [[Commissioner of the NBA|Commissioner]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) oversees all the '''fines handed out to NBA players and organizations''' for misconduct.

==Commissioner's role ==
In accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the NBA, the commissioner [[Adam Silver]] is responsible for overseeing fines handed out to players, owners, officers, managers, and coaches for acting in any way that is perceived to be “prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the game of [[basketball]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediacentral.nba.com/media/mediacentral/NBA-Constitution-and-By-Laws.pdf|website=mediacentral.nba.com|title=NBA Constitution and By-Laws|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.  There are no official rules dictating which specific actions deserve imposition of these fines, but if it is “in the opinion” of the commissioner that players have inappropriately conducted themselves, then the commissioner is legally obligated to hand out fines and/or give suspensions.

== Types of fines ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Fines in the NBA can be incurred for various reason and by various people. Players, teams, coaches, and owners can all incur fines. From 2003-2013 the top 5 most fined offenses were for criticizing referees (81 times, for about $2.1 million), fan confrontation (42 times, for $672,500), interaction with referees (35 times, for $750,000), fighting (26 times, for about $1.5 million), and flagrant fouls (22 times, for $295,000). Down further on the list are fines for media, flopping, social media, uniform violations (under [[NBA dress code|NBA Dress Code]]) and drugs. In all during this 10 year period the league gave a total of 341 fines for a total of $11,488,000. This total only includes fines that were made public and do not include any technical foul fines incurred during the course of a game.&lt;ref name=badly&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.besttickets.com/blog/nba-fines/|title=NBA Fines: Ballers Behaving Badly |date=2013-04-29|website=Best Tickets Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable fines ==
[[File:Rasheed_Wallace_2_cropped.jpg|thumb|Rasheed Wallace]]
The most fined player for the number of fines is [[Rasheed Wallace]], who has been fined 8 times for a total of $205,000. [[Vladimir Radmanovic]] is the player with the largest fine amount which is $500,000. He earned this fine for injuring his shoulder while snowboarding, which is in direct violation of his contract, not the snowboarding per se, but that he must keep himself healthy and safe in the off season.&lt;ref name=badly/&gt;

[[File:Phil_Jackson_Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching Michael Jordan]]
The most fined coach, for both the number of fines and total amount fined, is [[Phil Jackson]] for a total of $380,000 and a total of 8 fines. Coaches are most often fined for criticizing the refs. Jackson, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], and [[Doc Rivers]] are the top 3 most fined coaches, Brown with 7 fines totaling $117, 500 and Rivers with 6 fines totaling $115,000. These 3 coaches together account for 23 of the 54 fines given to coaches.&lt;ref name=badly/&gt;

The two teams that have been fined the most are the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]]; both teams were fined on 2 separate occasions for a total of $700,000. The Knicks and Nuggets both received fines for $500,000 for the fight they were in at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2006. The Los Angeles Lakers are the team with the most total number of fines with 6 fines, totaling $725,000. The largest team fine in NBA history is from 2000, to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] for $3.5 million. They were caught trying to secretly go over the salary cap for the year. This is also the largest fine amount that has ever been issued in the League.&lt;ref name=badly/&gt;

The most fined owner is [[Mark Cuban]], for 20 fines totaling $2,240,000; alone this is about 10% of all fines since 2000. Cuban is not only the most fined owner, he is the most fined individual person in NBA history, in terms of both total number of fines and total amount fined. His largest fine to date, $600,000 was for saying that the Dallas Mavericks should tank for the rest of the 2017-18 season. Cuban says every time he gets fined, he matches that amount and donates it to a charity of his choice.&lt;ref name=badly/&gt;

== Impact ==
As one of the world's highest-paid group of athletes, an NBA player's average salary is $4,001,760,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html|title=2015-16 NBA Player Contracts|website=BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some contracts are worth over $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/|title=NBA Contract Index|website=BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015-2016 season, 246 players were fined an amount totaling $5,463,829, giving an average per player of $22,210&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spotrac.com/nba/fines-suspensions/#player|title=NBA Fines &amp; Suspensions|website=Spotrac.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact to NBA players is approximately $150 to a person who makes $30,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/2014/05/30/interactive-nba-fine-calculator/9772191/|title=How much is a fine really worth to an NBA player?|website=Indianapolis Star|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA says that it allocates fine money to charity, although it is the only professional sports organization that does not publicize what specific charities receive donations.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The [[National Football League|NFL]] has contributed a large sum{{how much|date=June 2016}} to retired players with health problems, and to charities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] has had several instances where they have let players choose their own charity.&lt;ref name=where&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/s/2001/0406/1168454.html|title=ESPN.com: NBA - NBA Fines: Where does it go?|website=assets.espn.go.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program [[NBA Cares]] is in charge of choosing what charities the NBA will support; some of these include [[UNICEF]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club of America]], and [[Feed the Children]].

The fine money of NBA players isn't donated to charities directly, according to [[NBA collective bargaining agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/econ/faculty/Vrooman/NBA_CBA(2011)May30_2013.pdf|title=NBA COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT|website=VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA and [[National Basketball Players Association]] (NBPA) first equally split fines that collected from players, with half the fine going to the Players' Association and the league retaining the other half. Each then donates its portion to a group of charities of its choice.&lt;ref name=where/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21290">The composition of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[ethnicity]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has changed throughout the league's history.

==History==
===Players===
[[File:Earl_Lloyd_-_CIAA_HOF_Brunch_-_1-3-06.jpg|thumb|[[Earl Lloyd]] (right) was the first [[African American]] to play in the NBA]]
The NBA was founded in June 1946, with its first season played in [[1946–47 BAA season|1946–47]]. [[Wataru Misaka]] debuted in [[1947–48 BAA season|1947–48]] as the first non-white player and the first player of Asian descent to play in the league.&lt;ref name=vecsey/&gt;

African Americans first appeared in the NBA in 1950. [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] was the first black player [[National Basketball Association Draft|drafted]] in the NBA.&lt;ref name=color_line/&gt; On April 26, 1950, [[Harold Hunter (basketball coach)|Harold Hunter]] signed with the [[Washington Capitols]], becoming the first [[African American]] to sign a contract with any NBA team in history.&lt;ref name=kcstar&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam|last=McDowell|title=Sumner grad Harold Hunter, first African-American to sign with NBA team, dies at 86|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/03/08/4109211/sumner-grad-harold-hunter-first.html |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |publisher= |date=2013-03-09 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timespicayune&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=NBA pioneer Harold Hunter, an ex-Xavier coach, died Thursday |url=http://www.nola.com/xavier/index.ssf/2013/03/pioneering_coach_harold_hunter.html |work=[[Times-Picayune]] |publisher= |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hunter was cut from the team during training camp and did not play professionally.&lt;ref name=kcstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=timespicayune/&gt;&lt;ref name=citypaper&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Former Tennessee State basketball coach Harold Hunter dies |url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/former-tennessee-state-basketball-coach-harold-hunter-dies |work=[[The City Paper]] |publisher= |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton]] was the second African-American player to sign an NBA contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Dave|title=Six Who Paved the Way|work=NBA.com|url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/bhm_sixwhopavedtheway.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G6dT0QAi?url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/bhm_sixwhopavedtheway.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Jeremy|title=9.Firsts For African-Americans|work=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-100117/daily-dime|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G6dceCkA?url=http://espn.go.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-100117/daily-dime|archivedate=April 24, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some sources conflict and list Clifton as the first African-American to sign in the NBA.&lt;ref name=color_line/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spears|first=Marc J. |title=Chicago has long history of courtship|date=April 23, 2009|newspaper=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2009/04/23/chicago_has_long_history_of_courtship/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G6eGmWVx?url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2009/04/23/chicago_has_long_history_of_courtship/|archivedate=April 24, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} [[Earl Lloyd]] was the first to play in the NBA.&lt;ref name=color_line&gt;{{cite news |title=NBA's Color Line Is Broken |work=NBA.com |url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19501951.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eV7nzXV?url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19501951.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hank DeZonie]] also played that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pomerantz |first=Gary M. |page=54 |year=2005 |title=Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era |location=New York |publisher=Crown |isbn=1-4000-5160-6 |ref=pomerantz |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wilt1962nightof00pome }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, [[Don Barksdale]] became the first African American to play in an [[NBA All-Star Game]].&lt;ref name="Naismith Hall"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2012/2/24/five-direct-elects-for-the-class-of-2012-announced-by-the-na.html |title=Five Direct-Elects for the Class of 2012 Announced By the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emergence of African-American players by the 1960s, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black. At that time, African Americans believed they were limited by an [[gentlemen's agreement|unofficial]] league quota of four black players per team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pomerantz|Pomerantz 2005]], pp.53, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a number of commentators have remarked on the league's dwindling number of [[white American]] players. While a TIDES study found that the NBA was 18.3% white in the 2015–16 season, this number also included non-Americans, most notably Europeans. During the entire 1996–97 season, only three NBA teams did not field an American-born white; on the opening day of the 2016–17 season, eight teams did not have a white American on their roster, and an additional 10 teams had only one. At the latter point in time, fewer than 10% of NBA players were American-born whites (43 out of a possible 450).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/white-american-nba-players/ |title=Where Are All the White American NBA Players? |first=Marc J. |last=Spears |publisher=[[The Undefeated (website)|The Undefeated]] |date=October 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''expansion of the National Basketball Association''' has happened several times in the [[National Basketball Association|league]]'s history since it began play in 1946. The most recent instances of league expansion are the additions of the [[Charlotte Hornets]] in 1988, [[Miami Heat]] in 1989, [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] in 1995 (who [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] to [[Memphis Grizzlies|Memphis]] in 2001), and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fischer-Baum|first1=Reuben|last2=Silver|first2=Nate|title=The Complete History Of The NBA|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/|website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years: 1946–1966==
There was a lot of expansion and moving of organizations in the early years of the NBA. During this twenty year time period, several notable franchises entered the NBA, including the Syracuse Nationals (now the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]), the Philadelphia Warriors (now the [[Golden State Warriors]]), Minneapolis Lakers (now the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]), and Rochester Royals (now the [[Sacramento Kings]]).

During this time period the league experienced its first substantial growth, although it was short-lived, as the league was back down to nine teams by 1966.

==Later years: 1967–1980==
During this time period, 14 of the current 30 teams were brought into the league, beginning with the [[Chicago Bulls]] in 1966. The San Diego Rockets (now [[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (now [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]) joined the next season, with the [[Phoenix Suns]] and [[Milwaukee Bucks]] following them in 1968. Two seasons later, in 1970, the [[Buffalo Braves]] (became San Diego Clippers, now [[Los Angeles Clippers]]), [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] all began play. The New Orleans Jazz (now [[Utah Jazz]]) became the league's 18th franchise in 1974. The [[ABA–NBA merger]] in 1976 brought four original [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] teams to the NBA: the [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Indiana Pacers]], New York Nets (became New Jersey Nets, now [[Brooklyn Nets]]) and the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. In 1980, the expansion [[Dallas Mavericks]] were introduced, becoming the league's 23rd team.

==Modern expansion: 1981–present==
In this period, seven additional new NBA franchises have been formed, beginning the [[Charlotte Hornets]] and [[Miami Heat]] in 1988, and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]] the following year. The NBA expanded into Canada in 1995, bringing the [[Toronto Raptors]] and [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] (now [[Memphis Grizzlies]]) into the league. 

The Charlotte Bobcats (now the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets) were established in 2004 as the league's 30th franchise, following the relocation of the original Hornets to [[New Orleans]] in 2002. In 2013, the then-New Orleans Hornets rebranded as the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] and returned the Hornets name, history, and records to [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], where the Bobcats in-turn became the second and current iteration of the Charlotte Hornets. Due to the swap, the Pelicans are now regarded as being the newest team in the league, essentially a 2002 expansion team.

==Team timeline==

==Possible expansion cities==

===Seattle===
[[Seattle]] previously hosted the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from the {{nbay|1967}} season until the {{nbay|2007}} season, prior to the SuperSonics' [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|relocation]] to [[Oklahoma City]], and is a leading candidate to host a potential expansion NBA team.&lt;ref name="PradaSBNation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prada|first=Mike|title=Expansion team to Seattle looking more and more likely|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/10/25/13407914/nba-expansion-seattle-chris-hansen-arena-adam-silver|website=[[SB Nation]]|date=October 25, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2013 that the [[Sacramento Kings]] were close to [[Failed relocation of the Sacramento Kings|moving]] their franchise to Seattle, but the NBA Board of Owners voted against relocation, thus ensuring that the Kings would remain in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kings to stay in Sacramento as owners reject Seattle move|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/05/15/kings-stay-in-sacramento.ap/index.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=May 15, 2013|access-date=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, the only statements that have been made about the NBA returning to Seattle would be through expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Matt|title=With NBA expansion rumored, a look at the pros, cons and prospective cities|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/with-nba-expansion-rumored-a-look-at-the-pros-cons-and-prospective-cities/|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=October 13, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PradaSBNation" /&gt; On December 3, 2018, the renovation of what was once the [[KeyArena]] began, bringing the arena to current NBA standards and in preparation for the upcoming Seattle NHL team.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/KeyArena-renovation-city-council-vote-13254103.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Las Vegas===
[[Las Vegas]] is a potential city to host a future NBA team. There is the [[T-Mobile Arena]] that opened in 2017, which hosts ice hockey games for the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL)'s [[Vegas Golden Knights]]. A decade earlier, Las Vegas hosted the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]] in the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]'s [[Thomas and Mack Center]], despite not having a NBA team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kantowski |first1=Ron |title=Las Vegas moves giant step closer to landing NBA team |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/sports-columns/ron-kantowski/las-vegas-moves-giant-step-closer-to-landing-nba-team/ |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=December 23, 2018 |date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisville===
[[Louisville, Kentucky]] has two basketball arenas suitable for major league play: the downtown [[KFC Yum! Center]], which holds 22,090 and currently hosts the [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]], and [[Freedom Hall]], which holds 18,865. Both arenas have hosted well-attended NBA exhibition games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2014/11/10/nba-could-visit-louisville-again-next-year.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=4967977|title=Remembering Freedom Hall|date=5 March 2010|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisville has one prior major league basketball team in the [[Kentucky Colonels]], which was a successful franchise during their nine seasons in the [[American Basketball Association]], winning the ABA Finals in 1975 along with winning the most games and having the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the league's history. Since the Colonels were not included among the four ABA teams that were admitted into the NBA, Louisville has attempted to attract an NBA team, including the Buffalo Braves in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. Bruce, "Airball", JBM Partners, LLC, 2004, pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pgs. 142-145.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Houston Rockets,&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pgs. 167-220.&lt;/ref&gt; the Charlotte Hornets,&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pgs. 231-272.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Memphis Grizzlies&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., pgs. 273-313.&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 2000s.

===Pittsburgh===
Pittsburgh has a new arena, the [[PPG Paints Arena]] (which opened in 2010) that holds over 19,000 for basketball. It was rumored for a short time that the [[Detroit Pistons]] were moving to Pittsburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belko|first1=Mark|title=Pittsburgh mentioned in Pistons' relocation speculation|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2010/02/04/Pittsburgh-mentioned-in-Pistons-relocation-speculation/stories/201002040294|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=July 10, 2017|date=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pittsburgh was one of the cities mentioned by [[David Stern]] as a possible relocation site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigen|first1=Jonathan|title=Stern sees continued prosperity for NBA|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/article/Stern-sees-continued-prosperity-for-NBA-4267274.php|website=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=July 10, 2017|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh has a long basketball tradition with [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pitt]] and [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]] as well as more recently with [[Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball|Robert Morris Colonials]], the 1968 ABA champion [[Pittsburgh Condors]], the 1995 CBA finalist [[Pittsburgh Piranhas]], the [[Pittsburgh Rens]] of the [[American Basketball League (1961–63)|ABL]] and the [[Pittsburgh Ironmen]] of the [[Basketball Association of America|BAA]].

===Kansas City===
[[Kansas City, Missouri]] is one of the largest media markets without an NBA franchise, and a larger TV market than current NBA cities [[Oklahoma City]] and [[New Orleans]]. It previously hosted the [[Kansas City Kings]] from 1972 to 1985 (including three years where the team was shared with [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) until they moved to Sacramento. Like Pittsburgh, it has a recently built arena, the [[Sprint Center]], that has hosted [[Big 12]] and both the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|men's]] and [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|women's]] NCAA tournaments. The city is also home to the [[College Basketball Hall of Fame]].

===Hampton Roads/Virginia===
The [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area in [[Virginia]] has no major league sports team, but in August 2017, there was a proposal to bring an NBA team to the area's largest city, [[Virginia Beach]] whenever a sports arena is approved and built to host the team in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Minium |first1=Harry |title=Will an NBA team come to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront?

===Anaheim===
In 1987, [[Anaheim, California]] attempted to get an NBA team. They also attempted to draw in the [[Sacramento Kings]], which was the subject of relocation in 2012, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sanchez |first1=Leonel |title=Anaheim Not in Race for Expansion Team, NBA Spokesman Says |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-02/local/me-1890_1_expansion-team | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=December 23, 2018 |date=April 2, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ocregister.com/2011/03/07/anaheim-comes-first-in-name-if-nba-kings-move-here/ | title= ‘Anaheim’ comes first in name if NBA Kings move here | author= Eric Carpenter | |newspaper=[[Orange County Register]] | date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's arena, the [[Honda Center]] served as a secondary home for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] from 1994 to 1998.

===Vancouver===
[[File:Vancouver-gmplace3.jpg|thumb|[[General Motors Place]] was the home for the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] before the club's relocation to Memphis.The arena has since changed its name to [[Rogers Arena]]]]

The city of [[Vancouver]] previously hosted an NBA team (the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]) before it [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 2001 and became the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. The city has a solid fan base and the city already has a [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] team, the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. It has [[Rogers Arena]] as well as a large population of 2.4 million in the metro area and a large TV market, province-wide.

===Mexico City===
Since 1992, the [[NBA Global Games]] have had NBA games hosted in different places around the world, with [[Palacio de los Deportes]] in [[Mexico City]] (the capital and most populous city of the country) being one of the venues for hosting preseason games and regular season games, with the arena having a capacity of over 20,000.
On December 7, 2017, reports stated that the NBA would put a [[NBA G League]] team in the city for next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/sports/nba-g-league-mexico-city.html|title=N.B.A. Plans to Put a Minor League Team in Mexico City|first=Marc|last=Stein|date=7 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/12/7/16747368/nba-g-league-team-mexico-city-next-season|title=NBA will establish G-League team in Mexico City as soon as next season, per report|first=Tim|last=Cato|date=7 December 2017|website=SBNation.com|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was furthered fueled by Commissioner [[Adam Silver]]'s statement that the NBA has been in discussions to place a G League team in Mexico City as well opening of NBA Academy in that city for Latin American and Caribbean players.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nba.com/article/2017/12/07/nba-adam-silver-open-basketball-academy-mexico-city&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montreal===
Montreal is one of the largest markets in North America without an NBA franchise. It has a metropolitan population of four million and has an arena suitable for basketball, the [[Bell Centre]], which can hold up to 22,000 attendees. In addition, the city has regularly hosted the [[Toronto Raptors]]' preseason games. In 2018, a group of local businesspeople led by [[Michael Fortier]] have announced their intention of seeking investors for an expansion team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Group seeks investors for Montreal NBA team |url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/group-seeks-investors-montreal-nba-team/ |website=Sportsnet.ca |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8075">The '''GOAT''' Index ("Greatest of All Time") is a system used in sports to rank the best performers in any given role. The concept/name was created by author and analyst Ben Hinson and first used in a 2016 study Hinson created to rank the best [[NBA]] players from the mid 1970s - early 2000s. Hinson's system is the first player scoring methodology to assign different weights (value) to preseason and playoff performance in the scoring calculation. In 2017, [[ESPN]] published their first GOAT Index, ranking the best quarterbacks in the [[NFL]] from 1978 to 2017. The ESPN rankings were based on voting panels, not a scoring methodology.

== Hinson's GOAT Index ==
Hinson's GOAT Index, first published in December 2016 is the first player scoring system to factor in and weight preseason and playoff performance. The system was designed to rank the best [[NBA]] players based on calculated "GT Scores."&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7|title= The G.O.A.T (GT) Basketball Index: Mid 1970s – Early 2000s |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinson's GOAT (GT) Scores account for pacing and rotation minutes as each metric used is assessed on a per 36 minute basis (the only exception being Win Shares, which is assessed on a per 48 minute basis). Unlike Hollinger's [[Player Efficiency Rating]] and Game Scores, GT scores apply equal weight to each metric used, the idea being that no basketball performance metric is more important (or less) than others. By evenly applying defensive, offensive and contribution metrics, no particular player profile is favored. Metrics in the GT index are a combination of general stats like PPG and advanced stats like Win Shares and Usage Rates. Also, the GT Index is not based on a league average, but rather indexes the selected players against themselves, creating an "elite" and holistic way to evaluate performance. As it adjusts for rotation minutes, the GT Index rewards players who make the best use of their time on the court across all facets of the game. The GT Index also factors in effective shooting rates (eFG%), turnovers and personal fouls as weighted metrics, a key difference from Hollinger's PER and Game Scores. Hinson also maintains that traits like a players heart, ability to motivate teammates and other "soft/unmeasurable" traits factor into the Win Share metric.&lt;ref name="G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/g-o-a-t-scoring-faqs-basketball-3cc519585ee1|title= G.O.A.T Scoring FAQs |last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 16, 2017|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GOAT Score (GTS) Calculation (Basketball) ==

The formula for Hinson's basketball GT (GOAT) Scores is as follows:

'''Total GTS''',&lt;ref name="The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-basketball-index-all-star-edition-vol-1-d86c57575da|title= The G.O.A.T Basketball Index (All Star Edition vol.1)|last=Hinson|first=Ben|date=June 25, 2018|work=[[Hickam’s Dictum]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the full performance rating for an NBA player. This score combines selected regular season and playoff paced metrics and applies weights to reflect the difference in importance between regular season and playoff games:

[[File:GT Score Formula (Total GTS).jpg|1100x600px|alt=Example alt text]]

'''Playoffs GTS''', which focuses on the performance rating for an NBA player over the playoffs (can also be applied to regular season):

[[File:GT Score Formula (Playoffs GTS).jpg|1100x600px|alt=Example alt text]]

Legend:
* PTS/36 = Points per 36 mins
* eFG = Effective Field Goal %
* FT/36 = Free Throw % per 36 mins
* TRB/36 = Total Rebounds % per 36 mins
* AST/36 = Assist % per 36 mins
* STL/36 = Steals % per 36 mins
* BLK/36 = Block % per 36 mins
* TOV/36 = Turnovers per 36 mins
* USG = Usage Rate
* PF/36 = Personal Fouls per 36 mins
* WS/48 = Win Shares per 48 mins

''Note: For Total GTS, 6.05 equates to 0.06045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Total GTS, 3.05 equates to 0.03045455 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: For Playoffs GTS, 9.1 equates to 9.090909 rounded to one decimal place.''

''Note: totals in denominators refer to the selected player pool totals/averages, not league''

From Hinson's [https://hickamsdictum.com/the-g-o-a-t-who-is-the-best-basketball-player-of-all-time-e43c7e53a9a7 2016 GOAT Index], Hakeem Olajuwon edged out Michael Jordan by a fraction of a point to be the "GOAT" from the eras used in the study.

== ESPN GOAT Index ==

In July 2017, [[ESPN]] published [http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017 their first GOAT Index] aimed at ranking the top [[Quarterback|NFL quarterbacks]] in modern history. The ESPN GOAT Index like Hinson's earlier study also considered players from the 1970s, and utilized a voting panel consisting of NFL coaches and executives (all Super Bowl winners), each of whom voted on their top ten quarterbacks.&lt;ref name=" The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20096209/nfl-coaches-execs-rank-best-quarterbacks-modern-era-2017|title= The GOAT Index: NFL coaches, execs rank best QBs since 1978|last=Sando|first=Mike|date=July 19, 2017|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final quarterback rankings were determined based on how frequently any quarterback outranked his peers across all voting ballots. The ESPN voting panel consisted of Pete Carroll, [[Tony Dungy]], Mike Holmgren, Howard Mudd, Wade Phillips, Mike Reinfeldt, Ray Rhodes, Mike Shanahan, Al Saunders and Norv Turner.

[[Tom Brady]] emerged as the GOAT from the [[ESPN]] survey with 86.7% coverage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6415">An [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigation nicknamed Operation Slam Dunk began in 1994 surrounding untaxed income of at least 43 [[NBA]] referees regarding downgraded first-class or full-fare coach plane tickets that were paid for by the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) with the cost difference being pocketed by the referees without reporting that income on their tax returns. 

==Background==
In 1994, the National Basketball Association employed 54 referees. Each made between $72,000 and $177,000 a year, working about 70 to 75 games a year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=Deseret|title=35 NBA REFS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY IRS FOR TRAVEL EXPENSE SCAM|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/404168/35-NBA-REFS-UNDER-INVESTIGATION-BY-IRS-FOR-TRAVEL-EXPENSE-SCAM.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The travel expenses for referees were to be reimbursed by the NBA once a travel report was submitted. The NBA paid for a first class airline ticket for flights lasting longer than two hours and a full fare coach seat on flights shorter than two hours. In turn, the referees were permitted to downgrade their first class tickets and pocket the cost difference. This was considered a fringe benefit of the position and a way to supplement their income. The NBA did not withhold taxes on this income or report it to the IRS and the referees did not declare this income on their tax returns considering it a fringe benefit provided by their employer. 

In 1989, the IRS introduced new regulations that required an arrangement like the fringe benefits supported by the NBA to be reported as income. However, during the introduction of these new regulations, the NBA and the referees association were locked in a bargaining period over a new contract. During the negotiations the NBA changed the rules frequently which resulted in an unclear process on how to report the income causing many referees to continue the fringe benefits as they had in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barlett|first1=Donald|title=The Great American Tax Dodge: How Spiraling Fraud and Avoidance Are Killing Fairness, Destroying the Income Tax, and Costing You|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericantax00barl_0|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In 1993 the IRS received a tip that the referees were not declaring the airline ticket money as income resulting in the IRS launching "Operation Slam Dunk." On September 12, 1994, the IRS announced its investigation and notified more than 50 referees that they were part of a criminal tax investigation. The estimates of cash received ranged from $8,000 to $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montville|first1=Leigh|title=Called For Traveling APRIL 15 IS A DAY OF TORMENT FOR FOUR NBA REFEREES WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO TAX FRAUD AND LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY CASHED IN AIRLINE TICKETS--AND DIDN'T REPORT THE INCOME|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1998/04/20/241906/called-for-traveling-april-15-is-a-day-of-torment-for-four-nba-referees-who-pleaded-guilty-to-tax-fraud-and-lost-their-jobs-because-they-cashed-in-airline-tickets--and-didnt-report-the-income}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four years, the cases grew and dragged on resulting in 25 referees being turned over to the IRS civil division to be audited. Although the amount of lost tax revenue did not reach the IRS guidelines for criminal prosecution, the [[United States Department of Justice]] still decided to indict 12 referees. 

==Aftermath==
11 of the 12 indicted referees in 1998 plead guilty with only [[Steve Javie]] taking the case to trial and successfully being acquitted. 
More referees would become involved with a total of 43 choosing to plea bargain. The only additional referee to take his case to trial would be Ken Mauer, later found guilty. All of the referees involved were forced to resign from the NBA but were subsequently rehired after their guilty pleas.

===Notable consequences===

Jesse Ray Kersey pled guilty in 1997 and was sentenced to three years probation, ordered to pay a $20,000 fine, and file accurate amended tax returns and pay all taxes, interest, and penalties owed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HEISLER|first1=MARK|title=Blowing the Whistle on Referees Who Cheat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/29/news/ss-47848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Tolliver plead guilty to one count of filing a false tax return and was confined to six months of home detention, placed on probation for two years, ordered to completed 100 hours of community service and pay a $10,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Referee resigns|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023918/http://robots.cnnsi.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/24/referee_taxes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Javie was the only one of original 12 indicted referees to take the case to trial was acquitted more than four years after the investigation began. Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from [[frequent flyer]] miles, which are non-taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Dave|title=Steve Javie: One Stand-Up Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS case was cross examined and put under much scrutiny when asked why only part of the referees involved were indicted and questioning inconsistencies in arithmetic submitted as evidence by the IRS.

Ken Mauer was the only referee to be found guilty when he refused to accept a plea bargain, Mauer was convicted of a felony, three counts of tax evasion and one count of obstruction of justice. He was confined to house arrest for five months, three years of supervised release, and 800 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Ken|title=Mauer stood tall -- and pays the price|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/columns/hughes/1141856.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sentence Mauer remarked, 
"I'm not saying a mistake wasn't made. I'm not saying I've never made a mistake. But I never intended to commit a criminal act. I stood up for what I believe in. That is the only way I know how to live my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Ken|title=Mauer stood tall -- and pays the price|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/columns/hughes/1141856.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the punishment was served, Mauer was reinstated as an NBA referee.

The '''PLDT HOME: The Last Home Stand''' was a charity [[basketball]] event in the [[Philippines]], primarily sponsored by the [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and organized by East-West Private LLC, a US-based events organizing company, that featured the [[Philippine men's national basketball team]] (Gilas Pilipinas) together with the players from the [[National Basketball Association]].

Two [[exhibition game]]s between the Philippine national team and the NBA players were scheduled to be held on July 22 and 23 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], but were postponed moments before tipoff of the first game after the NBA players were warned by their league officials of possible penalties and suspensions if they took part in a basketball activity not recognized by the NBA. A drills showcase from both teams were hastily organized in place of the scheduled exhibition game, which was negatively received by the paying patrons of the event.&lt;ref name = "LHS"&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/last-home-stand-forced-to-cancel-exhibition-game-at-last-minute-organizers-ready-for-refund ‘Last HOME Stand’ forced to cancel exhibition game at last minute; Organizers ready to offer refund], Interaksyon.com, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers offered refunds for the ticket holders after the first exhibition game was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/pldt-announces-refund-process-for-last-home-stand-ticket-holders PLDT announces refund process for ‘Last Home Stand’ ticket holders], interaksyon.com, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the scheduled activities for July 23, which included a meet-and-greet event at [[SM Megamall]] and the second exhibition game at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/pba/news/nba-stars-left-early-wednesday-morningnba-stars-gilas-pilipinas-last-home-stand-basketball-charity-game-pldt-mvp-basketball-clinic-refund NBA stars leave country the morning after cancellation of tune-up games with Gilas], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The event was first announced through the [[Twitter]] account of PLDT chairman and [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] president [[Manny V. Pangilinan]] on June 25, 2014. In his Twitter post, he announced that NBA players [[Blake Griffin]], [[Damian Lillard]], [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Paul Pierce]] would take part in two exhibition games scheduled on July 22 and 23 against [[Gilas Pilipinas]], the Philippine men's basketball team, who are preparing for the [[2014 FIBA World Cup]]. The national team's coach, [[Chot Reyes]] also confirmed the event through his Twitter account. Skills coach [[John Lucas II]] will also conduct a skills training camp during the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/06/25/14/gilas-play-nba-all-stars-charity-game Gilas to play NBA All-Stars in charity game], [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBNnews.com]], June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket prices were announced days later through Ticketnet, the ticketing arm of the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], ranging from Php 23,330 (US$538.35) in the patron section to Php 750 (US$17.33) in the general admission section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ticketnet.com.ph/The-Last-Home-Stand-MNL-2014-All-Star-Charity-Event--Smart-Araneta-Coliseum/EventDetails/202 Event page of the PLDT Last Home Stand in Ticketnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706173146/http://ticketnet.com.ph/The-Last-Home-Stand-MNL-2014-All-Star-Charity-Event--Smart-Araneta-Coliseum/EventDetails/202 |date=2014-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pldt-the-last-home-stand-gilas-pilipinas-nba-manny-pangilinan-james-harden-paul-george-blake-griffin Tickets to Gilas tune-up against NBA stars Blake Griffin, Lillard won't come cheap.

On July 1, the organizers announced that [[Kyle Lowry]], [[Nick Johnson (basketball)|Nick Johnson]] and 2014 NBA Finals MVP [[Kawhi Leonard]] would also take part with the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/62073-leonard-lowry-johnson-gilas-last-home-stand NBA players Leonard, Lowry, Johnson also coming to Manila], Naveen Ganglani, [[Rappler]], July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul George]] was later added to the lineup according to Pangilinan in a post from his Twitter account on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/paul-george-added-to-list-of-basketball-stars-in-gilas-last-home-stand-charity-event Paul George added to list of basketball stars in 'Gilas Last HOME Stand' charity event], interaksyon.com, July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, [[James Harden]], [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Brandon Jennings]] were confirmed to be part of the event. They also announced that Paul Pierce had pulled out of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/63392-james-harden-tyson-chandler-brandon-jennings-gilas-last-home-stand Harden, Chandler, Jennings added to Last Home Stand], Naveen Ganglani, [[Rappler]], July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was organized by East-West Private LLC, a US-based events organizing company, who had been responsible for bringing in [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]], among others, to play in an exhibition game in the Philippines in 2011, entitled [[2010–11 PBA season#Smart Ultimate All-Star Weekend|Smart Ultimate All-Star Weekend]], while an [[2011 NBA lockout|NBA lockout]] was ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grantland.com/features/kobe-takes-manila-nba-not-invited/ Kobe Takes Manila; NBA Not Invited], Rafe Bartholomew, Gartland, August 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/sports/709718/after-ultimate-all-star-weekend-whats-next  After Ultimate All-Star Weekend, what's next?], [[Quinito Henson]], [[The Philippine Star]], July 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
Hours before the start of the first exhibition game on July 22, the organizers confirmed that [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Paul George]] had backed out of the event. In a video posted on the internet, Griffin apologized to the Filipino fans for not coming because "something from home needed my urgent attention". In a separate report, George cited "personal reasons" as the cause of his sudden pull-out. [[Matt Barnes]] became their last-minute replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/nba-starblake-griffin-paul-george-pull-out-of-gilas-tune-up-games-at-last-minute Organizers announce no-show for NBA stars Blake Griffin, Paul George from Gilas tune-up games at last minute], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/blake-griffin-paul-george-unable-to-make-trip-scratched-form-last-home-stand-lineup Blake Griffin, Paul George unable to make trip, scratched from 'Gilas Last HOME Stand' lineup], interaksyon.com, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After the traditional call up of players to the basketball court, Gilas Pilipinas coach [[Chot Reyes]] told the audience that the Gilas team and the NBA players would not be playing an exhibition game and would instead participate in a live open practice session.&lt;ref name = "GLS-audience"&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pldt-last-home-stand-fans-open-letter-expresses-disappointment-and-anger-gilas-pilipinas-nba-pba-manny-pangilinan-chot-reyes Fan at Big Dome gives us first-person perspective as Gilas vs NBA 'nightmare' unfolded before his eyes], spin.ph, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; PLDT Vice President Ariel Fermin then told the crowd that if they were not satisfied with the event, the organizers would be offering a full refund for the purchased tickets. He reminded the audience that the proceeds of the event will be given to charity, saying "''Tulungan niyo kaming tulungan ang ibang tao'' (Help us help other people), after all, this is really for a good cause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/371614/sports/opinion/commentary-wais-moves-led-to-gilas-vs-nba-cancellation-fiasco Commentary 'Wais' moves led to Gilas vs NBA cancellation fiasco], Jaemark Tordecilla, GMA News Online, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The event started with skills coach [[John Lucas II]] giving instructions to the players on drills, which were broken down in seven-minute segments. At first, the audience were responding positively with the drills, but as time went on, boos from the crowd started erupting after they realized that there will be no five-on-five game that night. When the event finished, the audience began to chant "REFUND! REFUND! REFUND!"&lt;ref name = "GLS-audience"/&gt;

In a hastily called press conference, and in an official statement issued that same day, PLDT chairman Manny Pangilinan apologized to the basketball fans "for disappointing them". He also cancelled the events planned for the second day. He said that refunds would be made to those people who had purchased tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/371512/sports/basketball/mvp-extends-sincerest-apologies-for-gilas-vs-nba-cancellation-assures-refund MVP extends 'sincerest apologies' for Gilas vs NBA cancellation, assures refund] GMA News Online, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pldthome.com/last-home-stand-official-statement PLDT Statement on The Last Home Stand Basketball Event], July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During the press conference, East West Holdings official Maria Espaldon told the media that they had not been able to secure clearance from the NBA to hold the event. In the hopes of having the event comply with the NBA's rules, the organizers set it up as a "basketball clinic" that also included a five-on-five scrimmage between the NBA players and the Gilas team. She also said that the event was never advertised as a game. Hours before the start of the event, the NBA players received calls from representatives of the league, who warned them that they were subject to possible fines and league suspensions should they take part in the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/pba/news/third-party-agency-admits-nba-declined-request-for-sanction-gilas-event-as-early-as-april Third-party agency admits NBA declined request for sanction on Gilas event as early as April], Snow Badua, spin.ph, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, the NBA released a press statement regarding the reported intervention of the league in the charity event. East-West Private LLC failed to secure the clearance needed from the NBA for their players to be allowed to participate in the event, as stated in the league's collective bargaining agreement, even after they informed the promoters about the process "several months ago"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.nba.com/news-article/2878/nba-issues-statement-on-the-gilas-last-home-stand#.U9J2h7G2qDo NBA issues statement on The Gilas Last Home Stand], NBA Philippines, July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The organizers reportedly spent up to P200 million (USD$4.6 million) for the event and paid the participating players up to US$150,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/how-much-did-organizers-lose-for-failed-nevent-source-gives-eye-popping-figure How much did organizers lose for failed event?

Refunds for the tickets were processed starting on July 24. Ticket holders who bought the tickets through Ticketnet were advised to go to the Smart Araneta Coliseum box office to claim their refunds. For those who bought the tickets online, their credit card charges were to be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pldthome.com/pldt-the-last-home-stand-refund-process Announcement to Last Home Stand ticket holders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727052422/http://pldthome.com/pldt-the-last-home-stand-refund-process |date=2014-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Basketball Association''' ('''NBA''') is a men's [[professional basketball]] [[sports league|league]] in [[North America]], composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is one of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]], and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.

The league was founded in [[New York City]] on June 6, 1946, as the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA).&lt;ref name="ANewLeagueNBA.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldaper|first=Sam|title=The First Game|url=http://www.nba.com/history/firstgame_feature.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL). The NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. Its playoffs extend into June. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportingIntelligence.com |title=REVEALED: The world's best paid teams, Man City close in on Barca and Real Madrid |url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2012/05/01/revealed-the-worlds-best-paid-teams-man-city-close-in-on-barca-and-real-madrid-010501/ |date=May 1, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaines|first1=Cork|title=The NBA is the highest-paying sports league in the world|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sports-leagues-top-salaries-2015-5|website=Business Insider|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA is an active member of [[USA Basketball]] (USAB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of USA Basketball|url=http://www.usab.com/about/inside-usa-basketball/members.aspx|publisher=[[USA Basketball]]|date=June 28, 2015|accessdate=June 28, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630155528/http://www.usab.com/about/inside-usa-basketball/members.aspx|archivedate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is recognized by [[FIBA]] (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the [[Sport governing body|national governing body]] for basketball in the United States. The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in [[Midtown Manhattan]], while its [[NBA Entertainment]] and [[NBA TV]] studios are directed out of offices located in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]].

==History==

===Creation and BAA–NBL merger (1946–1956)===
{{Main|Basketball Association of America}}
The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major [[ice hockey]] arenas in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, the [[Toronto Huskies]] hosted the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.&lt;ref name="firstgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Basketball in Canada|url=http://www.nba.com/canada/History_of_Basketball_in_Canad-Canada_Generic_Article-18023.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=March 8, 2002|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first basket was made by [[Ossie Schectman]] of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]] and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist [[Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)|Baltimore Bullets]] moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia|publisher=Villard Books|date=1994|page=34|isbn=0-679-43293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams–Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo–merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including [[Maurice Podoloff]] as president.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.

The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nba-is-born |title=NBA is born |work=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the [[New York Knicks]], [[Boston Celtics]], [[Philadelphia Warriors]], [[Minneapolis Lakers]], [[Rochester Royals]], [[Fort Wayne Pistons]], [[Tri-Cities Blackhawks]], and [[Syracuse Nationals]], all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] to [[Milwaukee]] in 1951, and then to [[St. Louis]] in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from [[Rochester, New York]], to [[Cincinnati]] in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], to [[Detroit]] in 1957.

[[Japanese-American]] [[Wataru Misaka]] broke the [[NBA color barrier]] in the [[1947–48 NBA season|1947–48 season]] when he played for the [[New York Knicks]]. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, [[Harold Hunter (basketball)|Harold Hunter]], signing with the [[Washington Capitols]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=kcstar&gt;{{cite news|first=Sam |last=McDowell |title=Sumner grad Harold Hunter, first African-American to sign with NBA team, dies at 86 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/03/08/4109211/sumner-grad-harold-hunter-first.html |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=March 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312014711/http://www.kansascity.com/2013/03/08/4109211/sumner-grad-harold-hunter-first.html |archivedate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timespicayune&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA pioneer Harold Hunter, an ex-Xavier coach, died Thursday |url=http://www.nola.com/xavier/index.ssf/2013/03/pioneering_coach_harold_hunter.html|work=[[Times-Picayune]]|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,&lt;ref name=kcstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=citypaper&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Tennessee State basketball coach Harold Hunter dies|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/former-tennessee-state-basketball-coach-harold-hunter-dies|work=[[The City Paper]]|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102164059/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/former-tennessee-state-basketball-coach-harold-hunter-dies|archivedate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] with the Celtics, [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton]] with the Knicks, and [[Earl Lloyd]] with the [[Washington Capitols]]. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center [[George Mikan]], won five [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]] and established themselves as the league's first [[Dynasty (sports)|dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1949–51: Lakers Win First NBA Finals|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html#4|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Lakers.com|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second [[shot clock]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Rules History|url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=May 8, 2008|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.

===Celtics' dominance, league expansion and competition (1956–1979)===
In 1957, rookie center [[Bill Russell]] joined the [[Boston Celtics]], which already featured guard [[Bob Cousy]] and coach [[Red Auerbach]], and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring ([[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100]]) and rebounding (55). [[Russell–Chamberlain rivalry|Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain]] became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.

[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bill Russell]] defending against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in 1966.]]

The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in [[1966–67 NBA season|1966–67]], but regained it in the [[1967–68 NBA season|1967–68 season]] and repeated in [[1968–69 NBA season|1969]]. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Championship Wins|url=https://www.nba.com/celtics/history/championships|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Celtics.com|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the [[Minneapolis Lakers]] to Los Angeles, the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] to San Francisco, the [[Syracuse Nationals]] to [[Philadelphia]] to become the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and the [[St. Louis Hawks]] moving to [[Atlanta]], as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now [[Washington Wizards]]) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (now [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]), [[San Diego Rockets]] (who relocated to [[Houston]] four years later), [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and [[Phoenix Suns]].

In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, [[Rick Barry]], jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees—[[Norm Drucker]], [[Earl Strom]], John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzberg|first=Charles|title=From Set Shot to Slam Dunk|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8032-9250-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Alan Siegel]], who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's [[Major League Baseball logo]] a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary [[Jerry West]] based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, "They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player." The iconic logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=That iconic NBA silhouette can be traced back to him|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/27/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100427|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://companylogos.ws/nbalogo.html NBA Logo Review] CompanyLogos.ws.

The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including [[Julius Erving]] of the [[Virginia Squires]], in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and [[Buffalo Braves]] (now the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1970–71 SEASON OVERVIEW|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19701971.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Orleans Jazz (now in [[Utah Jazz|Utah]]) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a [[ABA–NBA merger|settlement]] that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[New York Nets]] (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Rick Barry]], [[Dave Cowens]], [[Julius Erving]], [[Elvin Hayes]], [[Walt Frazier]], [[Moses Malone]], [[Artis Gilmore]], [[George Gervin]], [[Dan Issel]], and [[Pete Maravich]]. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the league.

===Surging popularity (1979–1998)===
The league added the ABA's [[three-point field goal]] beginning in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1979/10/11/new-twist-in-nba-the-3-point-goal/e5547a77-ec79-491c-af8e-b09966d893a6/|title=New Twist in NBA: the 3-Point Goal|last=DuPree|first=David|date=11 October 1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, rookies [[Larry Bird]] and [[Magic Johnson]] joined the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/endofcentury/s/century/katz.html|title=ESPN.com - ENDOFCENTURY - Katz: Magic and Bird did it all|website=www.espn.com|access-date=2019-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had faced each other in the [[1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game]], and they later played against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/la-lakers-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-greatest-moments-magic-johnson-kobe-bryant-shaq-oneal-phil-jackson-jerry-buss-062217|title=The 12 defining moments in Lakers history|last=ET|first=2017 at 9:17p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bird led the Celtics to three titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-13-sp-856-story.html|title=Bird's Salary Projected at $6 Million in '91-'92|date=1989-08-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the [[Dallas Mavericks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-11-08-ss-374-story.html|title=NBA: A Season Begins : Price of a Starting NBA Franchise Is Up to $32.5 Million|date=1988-11-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the total to 23 teams.

===Lakers' and Spurs' dynasties (1998–2014)===
Since the breakup of the [[Chicago Bulls]] championship roster in the summer of 1998, the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] has dominated. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of coach [[Phil Jackson]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] of [[Gregg Popovich]] combined to make 13 Finals in 16 seasons, with 10 titles. [[Tim Duncan]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] won the [[1999 NBA Finals|1999 championship]] with the [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|Spurs]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]] started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]] against the [[New Jersey Nets|Nets]]. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the [[2004 NBA Finals|Finals]], only to lose in five games to the [[Detroit Pistons]].

The league's image was marred by a [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|violent incident between players and fans]] in a November 2004 game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]]. In response, players were suspended for a total of 146 games with $11 million total lost in salary, and the league tightened security and limited the sale of alcohol.

After the Spurs took home the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] in [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], the [[2006 NBA Finals|2006 Finals]] featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The [[Miami Heat]], led by their star shooting guard, [[Dwyane Wade]], and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during summer 2004, won the series over the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], who were led by [[LeBron James]]. The [[2008 NBA Finals|2008 Finals]] saw a rematch of the league's [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|highest profile rivalry]], the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]], with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of [[Paul Pierce]], [[Ray Allen]], and [[Kevin Garnett]].

In 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the [[2009 NBA Finals|Finals]], this time defeating the [[Dwight Howard]]-led [[2008–09 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. Bryant won his first [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2009061419&amp;prov=ap |title=Redemption: Bryant leads Lakers to 15th NBA title|last1=Withers|first1=Tom|date=June 15, 2009|work=[[Yahoo!

Two free agents signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and [[Chris Bosh]], did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]] (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans [[Shawn Marion]], [[Jason Kidd]], [[Jason Terry]], and [[Peja Stojaković]] celebrated their first NBA championship.

On July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced [[2011 NBA lockout|another lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Stein | authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) | title=NBA cancels first 2 weeks of season | date=October 11, 2011 | url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7085089/nba-labor-david-stern-cancels-first-two-weeks-nba-season | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/sports/basketball/nba-owners-and-players-ratify-labor-deal.html|title=N.B.A. Owners and Players Ratify Labor Deal|date=December 9, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh against [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]'s [[Kevin Durant]], [[Russell Westbrook]], and [[James Harden]]. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the [[2013 NBA Finals]]. The two teams would meet for a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the Heat in five games. Off the court, commissioner David Stern retired on February 1, 2014, exactly 30 years to the day from taking office. He was succeeded by his deputy, [[Adam Silver]].

===Modern era (2014–present)===
Following the 2014 Finals, LeBron James announced that he would return to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. James led the Cavaliers to their second Finals appearance, where they lost to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in six games. The following year, in a rematch, the [[2016 NBA Finals]] concluded with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first NBA Championship. The [[Cavaliers–Warriors rivalry|dominance of those two teams]] continued in 2017, when the Warriors, having signed Kevin Durant as a free agent, took the third straight Finals matchup between the two teams in five games, with Durant named Finals MVP, and again in 2018 when they went to a fourth straight Finals matchup.

During free agency in 2018, LeBron James signed with the Lakers. In the following season, the Warriors returned to the Finals for the fifth straight year, where they were defeated by the [[Toronto Raptors]] in six games.

===International influence===
{{Further|List of foreign NBA players}}

Following pioneers like [[Vlade Divac]] ([[Serbia]]) and [[Dražen Petrović]] ([[Croatia]]) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced [[EuroLeague]] teams [[NBA vs. EuroLeague games|in exhibition matches]] in the [[NBA Europe Live Tour]], and since 2009, in the [[EuroLeague American Tour]]. The [[2013–14 NBA season|2013–14 season]] opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2013/10/29/record-92-foreign-players-on-nba-rosters-to-start-season/|title=Record 92 foreign players on NBA rosters to start season|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the 2017-18 season saw a record 108 international players representing 42 different countries marking 4 consecutive years of at least 100 international players and each team having at least one international player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NBA rosters feature 108 international players from record 42 countries and territories|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/17/nba-international-players-2017-18-season-record-countries|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=October 17, 2017|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Phoenix Suns]] hired Serbian coach [[Igor Kokoškov]] as their new head coach, replacing Canadian interim coach [[Jay Triano]], making Kokoškov the first European coach to become a head coach for a team in the NBA.

===Other developments===
In 2001, an affiliated [[minor league]], the National Basketball Development League, now called the [[NBA G League]], was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: NBA G League|url=https://gleague.nba.com/faq/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=GLeague.NBA.com|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the [[Continental Basketball Association]], and call it its developmental league.

Two years after the Hornets' relocation to [[New Orleans]], the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]] were formed as an [[expansion team]] in 2004.&lt;!--The NBA officially considers the Bobcats as part of the current Hornets' history.--&gt;

The Hornets [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|temporarily relocated]] to [[Oklahoma City]] in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.

A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA Introduces New Game Ball|url=http://www.nba.com/news/blackbox_060628.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=June 28, 2006|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]], the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.

Commissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2694335 |last=Stein |first=Marc |title=Leather ball will return on Jan. 1 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 12, 2006 |authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NBA Players Association|Players' Association]] had filed a suit on behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;id=2689744 |title=NBA ball controversy reaches new level |last=Stein |first=Marc |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 8, 2006 |authorlink=Marc Stein (reporter) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2017–18 season, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], replacing the previous supplier, [[Adidas]].

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee [[Tim Donaghy]] bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the [[point spread]] in those games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095 Donaghy under investigation for betting on NBA games], [[ESPN]]. July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain referees were friendly with players and "company men" for the NBA, and he alleged that referees influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a "singing, cooperating witness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2002 Lakers-Kings Game 6 at heart of Donaghy allegations |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401 |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Virgin |first=Ryan |title=David Stern and Tim Donaghy's Motives Are Not That Different

On alleged "star treatment" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, "there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beech |first=Ronald |title=Reviewing the calls: Lakers-Kings Game 6 |url=http://www.82games.com/lakerskingsgame6.htm |year=2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] and [[NBA Development League]] were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995–96 season.

The first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the [[New Jersey Nets]] faced the [[Toronto Raptors]] at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London in front of over 20,000 fans.

The [[2011–12 NBA season]], scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was [[2011 NBA lockout|postponed due to a labor dispute]]. The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.

After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets were renamed the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Orleans Pelicans Officially Adopt New Namesake|url=http://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/new-orleans-pelicans-officially-adopt-new-namesake|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Pelicans.com|date=April 18, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner [[Adam Silver]] ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.&lt;ref name=hornets_name_returns&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|access-date=December 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the [[National Football League|NFL]].)

[[Donald Sterling]], who was then-owner of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clippers owner Sterling banned for life by the NBA|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/04/29/nba-bans-donald-sterling.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its teams to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s logo, marking the first time a manufacturer's logo would appear on NBA jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA would become the first [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports league]] to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms, and the last to have a uniform manufacturer logo appear on its team uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Brian|title=NBA to begin selling jersey sponsorships in 2017-18|url=http://www.nba.com/2016/news/04/15/nba-to-begin-selling-jersey-sponsorships-in-2017-18.ap/index.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], who agreed to a deal with [[StubHub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Philadelphia 76ers And StubHub Announce First Jersey Sponsorship In Major American Professional Sports|url=http://www.nba.com/sixers/philadelphia-76ers-and-stubhub-announce-first-jersey-sponsorship-major-american-professional-sports|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Sixers.com|date=May 15, 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it is largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a "richer" color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the [[2017 NBA Summer League]], but it will not immediately be used on equipment or uniforms due to [[lead time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A first look at the NBA's refreshed logo|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/06/first-look-nbas-refreshed-logo-2017-18-season|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA also officially released new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] uniforms for all 30 teams beginning with the 2017–18 season. The league eliminated "home" and "away" uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four or six uniforms: the "Association" edition, which is the team's white uniform, the "Icon" edition, which is the team's color uniform, and two other uniform editions, to be unveiled at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Lang|title=NBA, Nike unveil new uniforms for 2017-18 season|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/18/nba-nike-new-uniforms#/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=July 18, 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{geoGroup|float=left}}

The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.

The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]]. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the [[Eastern Time Zone]], nine in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]], three in the [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], and five in the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]].

==Regular season==
Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the [[NBA G League]]. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.

During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the [[strength of schedule]] will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).

The NBA is one of only two of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the [[National Hockey League]]). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.

The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on [[Christmas]] Day.&lt;ref name=Christmas&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuhmann|first=John|title=Knicks, Kobe and more part of Christmas Day lore|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/john_schuhmann/12/17/numbers.christmas/index.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=December 17, 2009|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league has been playing [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|games]] regularly on the holiday since 1947,&lt;ref name=ChristmasMatchups&gt;{{cite news|title=Christmas Tradition|newspaper=The Riverside (Ca.)

In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual [[NBA All-Star Game]]. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the [[Internet]], and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|Game MVP award]]. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the [[Rising Stars Challenge]] (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the [[Skills Challenge]], where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the [[Three Point Contest]], where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.

Shortly after the All-Star break is the [[trade deadline]], which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Trading Deadline Trades Since 1987|url=http://www.nba.com/history/deadline_deals.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.

Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|Sixth Man of the Year Award]] is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year Award]] is awarded to the league's best defender. The [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]] is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, ''[[Sporting News]]'' awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year Award]] to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.

The post-season teams are the [[All-NBA Team]], the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Team]], and the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie Team]]; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Playoffs==
{{Main|NBA playoffs}}
The NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).

Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006–07 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the sixth seed had a better record than the team with the third seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the sixth seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the [[Denver Nuggets]] won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the third seed. Their opponent was the sixth-seeded [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.

The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the [[NBA Finals]] followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2–2–1–1–1|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the [[NBA Finals]], and is held annually in June. The winner of the NBA Finals receives the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] to the best performing player of the series.

The league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015–16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBA to seed playoff teams in each conference by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-playoff-seeding-change-ap.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
{{Main|National Basketball Association on television}}
{{See also|List of current National Basketball Association broadcasters}}
As one of the major sports leagues in North America, the NBA has a long history of partnerships with television networks in the United States. The NBA signed a contract with [[DuMont Television Network]] in its eighth season, the [[1953-54 NBA season|1953–54 season]], marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to the [[National Football League]], the lack of television stations led to [[NBC]] taking over the rights from the [[1954-55 NBA season|1954-55 season]] until April 7, 1962–NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with [[ESPN]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] through the 2024–25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over [[regional sports network]]s specific to the area where the teams are located.

==International competitions==
The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the [[FIBA|Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA)]] in the [[McDonald's Championship]]. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=3754278 |title=New club basketball championship to debut in 2010 |date=December 9, 2008 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticket prices and viewership demographics==
In 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authors= |date=January 2013 |title= |journal=[[Reader's Digest]] |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewership demographics===
According to Nielsen's survey, in 2013 the NBA had the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with [[Major League Baseball]], to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest share of [[African Americans|black]] viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being [[White American|white]], making it the only top North American sport that does not have a white majority audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/|title=Which Sports Have the Whitest/Richest/Oldest Fans?|first=Derek|last=Thompson|date=February 10, 2014|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the NBA's popularity further declined among White Americans, who during the 2016–17 season, only made up 34% of the viewership. At the same time, the black viewership increased to 47 percent, while Hispanic (of any race) stood at 11 percent and Asian viewership stood at 8 percent. According to the same poll, the NBA was favored more strongly by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] than [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://morningconsult.com/2018/01/25/nfl-isnt-divisive-sport-america/|title=The NFL Isn't the Only Divisive Sport in America|last=Piacenza|first=Joanna|date=January 25, 2018|publisher=Morning Consult}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|List of foreign NBA players}}
Following pioneers like [[Vlade Divac]] ([[Serbia]]) and [[Dražen Petrović]] ([[Croatia]]) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:
&lt;!--The following list only lists notable international players who had NEVER attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Only one from each country, thanks.--&gt;

&lt;!--Please don't put Steve Nash and Andrew Bogut in the list, as both of them had attended U.S. colleges. They are mentioned directly below.--&gt;

On some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are:
* Nigerian [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[1984 NBA draft|top draft pick in 1984]], 2-time champion, 12-time All-Star, 1994 MVP, 1994 and 1995 Finals MVP, 1994 and 1995 Defensive Player of the Year, only player to receive the MVP Award, Defensive Player of the Year Award, and Finals MVP award in the same season, and Hall of Famer)

* Sudanese-born Englishman [[Luol Deng]] (2007 winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]], 2-time All-Star)
*Cameroonian Joel Embiid (NBA All-Rookie First Team, 2 time All-Defensive Second Team, 2 time All-Star)

Since 2006, the NBA has faced [[EuroLeague]] teams [[EuroLeague vs. NBA games|in exhibition matches]] in the [[NBA Europe Live Tour]], and since 2009 in the [[EuroLeague American Tour]].

The [[2013–14 NBA season|2013–14 season]] opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The NBA defines "international" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that:
* Players born in U.S. possessions such as [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S., Virgin Islands]], most notably USVI native [[Tim Duncan]], are counted as "international" even though they are U.S. citizens by birth, and may even have represented the U.S. in international competition (like Duncan).
* U.S.-born players are not counted as "international" even if they were born with citizenship in another country and represent that country internationally, such as [[Joakim Noah]], and [[Kosta Koufos]].

'''NBLxNBA''' is an annual series involving clubs from the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) of [[Australia]] and the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) of the [[United States of America]]. The series started in 2017 for each leagues 2017–18 season, and each season includes between three and seven games. The games have previously always been held in America and [[Canada]], and typically are held during September and early October.

==Seasons==
===2017–18 season===
In 2017 the NBL announced that the [[Brisbane Bullets]], [[Melbourne United]] and the [[Sydney Kings]] would compete in games against three [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams in the inaugural NBLxNBA series.&lt;ref name="nblxnba 17"&gt;{{cite web |title=What We Learned from NBL x NBA |url=http://www.aussiehoopla.com/what-we-learned-from-nbl-x-nba/ |website=Aussie Hoopla |language=en-AU |date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite losing all three games (including a one point thriller), the series was marked as a success for the NBL as it brought in much higher television ratings than the teams were used to,&lt;ref name="nblxnba 17" /&gt; and it showed how competitive the league is. The series also drew the attention of multiple high profile NBA players, including Australian [[Ben Simmons]] who expressed his interest in competing in a future NBLxNBA game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Simmons wants a piece of NBL action |url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/basketball/philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons-wants-a-piece-of-nbl-action/news-story/ca96cde05a7d05199d691955a3c08638 |website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au |language=en |date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018–19 season===
The NBL announced a second series on 27 June 2018, with five of their eight clubs travelling to the [[United States of America]] to complete in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBLxNBA is back, and it's bigger than ever |url=https://pickandroll.com.au/nblxnba-back-bigger-better-than-ever/ |website=pickandroll.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clubs which didn't complete were the [[Brisbane Bullets]], [[Cairns Taipans]] and [[Illawarra Hawks]].

The [[Adelaide 36ers]] reached the highest score by the NBL teams and fell one point short of the elusive 100 points milestone, but the NBL teams failed to record a victory for a second year in a row.

===2019–20 season===
On July 4, 2019 it was announced that the [[Adelaide 36ers]], [[Melbourne United]] and the [[New Zealand Breakers]] would play the [[Utah Jazz]], [[Memphis Grizzlies]], [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Sacramento Kings]] in the 2019 edition of NBLxNBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBL news: NBLxNBA NBA preseason games, NBA preseason, Los Angeles Clippers, schedule |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/nbl-teams-to-feature-in-five-nba-preseason-games-in-october/news-story/ea3c73545e23c07a9ad1b9a61dc5ec4e |website=Fox Sports |language=en-AU |date=3 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was pushed closer towards the start of the NBA series, which meant the [[Adelaide 36ers]] and [[New Zealand Breakers]] missed the beginning of the NBL season, and [[Melbourne United]] missed a fortnight of the early rounds of the season.

Despite the NBL losing streak continuing, this series marked the first time an NBL team reached the 100 point mark against an NBA team. This happened in both [[Melbourne United]] games against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Sacramento Kings]].
